### Initial Condition:  
- The device is powered on and in Category 1 (Player/Recorder) mode.  
- The device is connected to a media source (e.g., a DVD or streaming service) and is ready to play media.  
- The "play" operation is supported by the device according to the support level table (C1 for Category 1).  

### Test Procedure:  
1. Press the **play** button on the device's remote control or interface.  
2. Release the **play** button after a short delay (e.g., 1 second).  
3. Observe the device's response and verify if the media starts playing.  

### Expected Outcome:  
- The device starts playing the media immediately after the **play** button is released.  
- The PASS THROUGH operation correctly triggers the "play" command, adhering to the mandatory support level (C1) for Category 1.  
- No error messages or unexpected behavior occur during or after the operation.




Original TC = Press and release – CT

Test Purpose:
Verify that the button release is sent following a button press when the CT issues a PASS THROUGH
command.

Initial Condition:
- One ACL connection exists between the IUT and the Lower Tester.
   - The AVCTP connection between the IUT and the Lower Tester is completed.
   - The IUT is acting as AVRCP CT.

Test Procedure:
The Upper Tester triggers the IUT to issue commands for button press and release.

Expected Outcome:
Pass verdict
The IUT issues a correctly formatted PASS THROUGH command with the state flag set to button
press, followed within 2 seconds by a correctly formatted PASS THROUGH command with the same
operation id with the state flag set to button release.
