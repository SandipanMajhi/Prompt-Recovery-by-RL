The Lower Tester sends a Request Continuing Response command to the IUT.\n4. The IUT sends a Get Element Attributes response with more characters.\n5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4, as necessary, until the Lower Tester receives all of the remaining\n\ncharacters from the IUT. The final Get Element Attributes response is indicated with 0x3 (END)\nfor packet type. Any additional Get Element Attributes responses between the START (0x1) and\nEND (0x3) should have a packet type of CONTINUE (0x2).\n\n\n_Figure 4.130: AVRCP/TG/RCR/BV-02-C [Request continuing response – TG] MSC_"
