Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

The idea is that visually\noriented people --aka designers-- would likely remember a website more by it's\ndesign and appearance than the name or current title of the website that they\nsaw for the split second while they click **OK** on the **Add Bookmark**\nWindow. Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage. This will not only serve the purpose mentioned above, but also allow\naccess to the text on the page(for copy/paste etc). I often bookmark pages\nbecause they contain some useful snippet of information and not because I plan\nto visit them repeatedly. Having a saved copy of the page gives the user\noffline access to the contents on the day the page was bookmarked.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

But it\nmay be better to have two separate interfaces.\n\nThe menu's purpose is fast access to frequently visited websites, also\nreferred to as FAVORITES. In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly. Tagging seems a perfect tool to categorize\nthese bookmarks for the WEB INDEX in a very flexible, quick, and simple way.\nFor more details please see:\n<http://pubnotes.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/rethinking-bookmarks-ui/>"

Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox. Is it possable that\nthis could be included? Pretty please!\n\nI REALLY would LOVE a solution to this Please help....

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.

Similar use\ncases would be remembering items you are comparing to purchase, funny pages\nyou want to show friends, long articles you are reading, remembering\nconferences or other events that will lose relevance shortly, and remembering\nstories to write a blog entry about.\n\nIn firefox 2 this sort of use is very cumbersome. With 'add bookmark here'\nbookmarks can be added efficently enough but every time one wants to remove\nbookmarks you need to go to the manage bookmark's screen. Some more efficent\nmeans of removing temporary bookmarks is needed, perhaps several. The\nfollowing features all seem good:\n\n1) Expiration times for bookmarks, when created you can specify a date on\nwhich the bookmark will be deleted/become invisible.\n\n2) Folder based expiration times, particular folders could time out bookmarks\nwhen they age past a certain date.\n\n3) Most recently used display with bookmarks disappearing after they fall\nbelow some threshold.\n\n4) The above but at the user's request.\n\n5) Easy option to delete without entering the organize bookmarks page.\n\nOf course all of these really need appropriate sort option.\n\n    \n\n    How about a special tag called \"temp\" that only keeps things for one or two days?\n    How about a tag \"new\" that is removed as soon as you click on it?\n    How about per-tag expiry rules?\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:12, 7 June 2007 (PDT)"

In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly. Tagging seems a perfect tool to categorize\nthese bookmarks for the WEB INDEX in a very flexible, quick, and simple way.\nFor more details please see:\n<http://pubnotes.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/rethinking-bookmarks-ui/>"

Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox. Is it possable that\nthis could be included? Pretty please!\n\nI REALLY would LOVE a solution to this Please help.... Thanks! --\n[UKPhoenix79](/User:UKPhoenix79 \"User:UKPhoenix79\") 23:21, 13 July 2006 (PDT)"

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything.

A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage. This will not only serve the purpose mentioned above, but also allow\naccess to the text on the page(for copy/paste etc). I often bookmark pages\nbecause they contain some useful snippet of information and not because I plan\nto visit them repeatedly.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

In contrast to Firefox, the old bookmark editor of Netscape\nCommunicator is very fast and convenient. Moving and copying bookmarks between\n(sub)folders is much faster than with Firefox and Mozilla, in particular, on\nSun Solaris. Please learn from the old editors!\n\nIn particular, I have hundreds of folders and subfolders with thousands of\nbookmarks. And the function \"Find in Bookmarks\" of Netscape Communicator\nallows to search for text in bookmarks as well as in folder/subfolder titles\nand to jump from one search hit to the next search hit within the tree.\n\nExample: Using the search string \"Java\", it is very useful to find all\nsubfolders titled \"Java applications/programming/etc.\" contained in diverse\nfolders named \"applications\" and \"programming\".\n\nTo sum up, make the folder titles and bookmarks searchable at the same time!\nThe resulting list should return folders and bookmarks that contain the search\nstring anywhere in their title/name/location/description/tags. Alternatively,\nthe user should be able to jump from one hit to the next hit in the bookmark\ntree as it is implemented in the Netscape Communicator.\n\nIf some user does not want to find folder titles, then the user should be able\nto turn this off.

In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly. Tagging seems a perfect tool to categorize\nthese bookmarks for the WEB INDEX in a very flexible, quick, and simple way.\nFor more details please see:\n<http://pubnotes.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/rethinking-bookmarks-ui/>"

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."

Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox. Is it possable that\nthis could be included? Pretty please!\n\nI REALLY would LOVE a solution to this Please help....

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage. This will not only serve the purpose mentioned above, but also allow\naccess to the text on the page(for copy/paste etc).

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

Another would be\nto implement [bug\n#255274](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=255274), to have the\ncapability of having a style-sheet control the display format (e.g., line\nspacing, margins, font size). Of course, all this should include making the\nbookmarks file a valid HTML file, including a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.\n\nAnother display bug that should be fixed is\n[#245934](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=245934). The Bookmarks\nManager normalized window size is forgotten if the window was maximized when\nit was closed."

In contrast to Firefox, the old bookmark editor of Netscape\nCommunicator is very fast and convenient. Moving and copying bookmarks between\n(sub)folders is much faster than with Firefox and Mozilla, in particular, on\nSun Solaris. Please learn from the old editors!\n\nIn particular, I have hundreds of folders and subfolders with thousands of\nbookmarks. And the function \"Find in Bookmarks\" of Netscape Communicator\nallows to search for text in bookmarks as well as in folder/subfolder titles\nand to jump from one search hit to the next search hit within the tree.\n\nExample: Using the search string \"Java\", it is very useful to find all\nsubfolders titled \"Java applications/programming/etc.\" contained in diverse\nfolders named \"applications\" and \"programming\".\n\nTo sum up, make the folder titles and bookmarks searchable at the same time!\nThe resulting list should return folders and bookmarks that contain the search\nstring anywhere in their title/name/location/description/tags. Alternatively,\nthe user should be able to jump from one hit to the next hit in the bookmark\ntree as it is implemented in the Netscape Communicator.\n\nIf some user does not want to find folder titles, then the user should be able\nto turn this off.

In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."

Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage. This will not only serve the purpose mentioned above, but also allow\naccess to the text on the page(for copy/paste etc).

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

Another would be\nto implement [bug\n#255274](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=255274), to have the\ncapability of having a style-sheet control the display format (e.g., line\nspacing, margins, font size). Of course, all this should include making the\nbookmarks file a valid HTML file, including a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.\n\nAnother display bug that should be fixed is\n[#245934](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=245934). The Bookmarks\nManager normalized window size is forgotten if the window was maximized when\nit was closed."

In contrast to Firefox, the old bookmark editor of Netscape\nCommunicator is very fast and convenient. Moving and copying bookmarks between\n(sub)folders is much faster than with Firefox and Mozilla, in particular, on\nSun Solaris. Please learn from the old editors!\n\nIn particular, I have hundreds of folders and subfolders with thousands of\nbookmarks. And the function \"Find in Bookmarks\" of Netscape Communicator\nallows to search for text in bookmarks as well as in folder/subfolder titles\nand to jump from one search hit to the next search hit within the tree.\n\nExample: Using the search string \"Java\", it is very useful to find all\nsubfolders titled \"Java applications/programming/etc.\" contained in diverse\nfolders named \"applications\" and \"programming\".\n\nTo sum up, make the folder titles and bookmarks searchable at the same time!\nThe resulting list should return folders and bookmarks that contain the search\nstring anywhere in their title/name/location/description/tags. Alternatively,\nthe user should be able to jump from one hit to the next hit in the bookmark\ntree as it is implemented in the Netscape Communicator.\n\nIf some user does not want to find folder titles, then the user should be able\nto turn this off.

In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly. Tagging seems a perfect tool to categorize\nthese bookmarks for the WEB INDEX in a very flexible, quick, and simple way.\nFor more details please see:\n<http://pubnotes.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/rethinking-bookmarks-ui/>"

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page.

Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

The idea is that visually\noriented people --aka designers-- would likely remember a website more by it's\ndesign and appearance than the name or current title of the website that they\nsaw for the split second while they click **OK** on the **Add Bookmark**\nWindow. Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage. This will not only serve the purpose mentioned above, but also allow\naccess to the text on the page(for copy/paste etc). I often bookmark pages\nbecause they contain some useful snippet of information and not because I plan\nto visit them repeatedly. Having a saved copy of the page gives the user\noffline access to the contents on the day the page was bookmarked.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

But it\nmay be better to have two separate interfaces.\n\nThe menu's purpose is fast access to frequently visited websites, also\nreferred to as FAVORITES. In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly. Tagging seems a perfect tool to categorize\nthese bookmarks for the WEB INDEX in a very flexible, quick, and simple way.\nFor more details please see:\n<http://pubnotes.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/rethinking-bookmarks-ui/>"

I really like Firefox but I find that it is missing one key feature for me to transition from Mozilla 1.7.12 to Firefox 1.5.0.4, that is the lack of the same Mozilla \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" feature in Firefox. Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox. Is it possable that\nthis could be included? Pretty please!\n\nI REALLY would LOVE a solution to this Please help....

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.

Similar use\ncases would be remembering items you are comparing to purchase, funny pages\nyou want to show friends, long articles you are reading, remembering\nconferences or other events that will lose relevance shortly, and remembering\nstories to write a blog entry about.\n\nIn firefox 2 this sort of use is very cumbersome. With 'add bookmark here'\nbookmarks can be added efficently enough but every time one wants to remove\nbookmarks you need to go to the manage bookmark's screen. Some more efficent\nmeans of removing temporary bookmarks is needed, perhaps several. The\nfollowing features all seem good:\n\n1) Expiration times for bookmarks, when created you can specify a date on\nwhich the bookmark will be deleted/become invisible.\n\n2) Folder based expiration times, particular folders could time out bookmarks\nwhen they age past a certain date.\n\n3) Most recently used display with bookmarks disappearing after they fall\nbelow some threshold.\n\n4) The above but at the user's request.\n\n5) Easy option to delete without entering the organize bookmarks page.\n\nOf course all of these really need appropriate sort option.\n\n    \n\n    How about a special tag called \"temp\" that only keeps things for one or two days?\n    How about a tag \"new\" that is removed as soon as you click on it?\n    How about per-tag expiry rules?\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:12, 7 June 2007 (PDT)"

In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly. Tagging seems a perfect tool to categorize\nthese bookmarks for the WEB INDEX in a very flexible, quick, and simple way.\nFor more details please see:\n<http://pubnotes.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/rethinking-bookmarks-ui/>"

Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox. Is it possable that\nthis could be included? Pretty please!\n\nI REALLY would LOVE a solution to this Please help.... Thanks! --\n[UKPhoenix79](/User:UKPhoenix79 \"User:UKPhoenix79\") 23:21, 13 July 2006 (PDT)"

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything.

A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage. This will not only serve the purpose mentioned above, but also allow\naccess to the text on the page(for copy/paste etc). I often bookmark pages\nbecause they contain some useful snippet of information and not because I plan\nto visit them repeatedly.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

In contrast to Firefox, the old bookmark editor of Netscape\nCommunicator is very fast and convenient. Moving and copying bookmarks between\n(sub)folders is much faster than with Firefox and Mozilla, in particular, on\nSun Solaris. Please learn from the old editors!\n\nIn particular, I have hundreds of folders and subfolders with thousands of\nbookmarks. And the function \"Find in Bookmarks\" of Netscape Communicator\nallows to search for text in bookmarks as well as in folder/subfolder titles\nand to jump from one search hit to the next search hit within the tree.\n\nExample: Using the search string \"Java\", it is very useful to find all\nsubfolders titled \"Java applications/programming/etc.\" contained in diverse\nfolders named \"applications\" and \"programming\".\n\nTo sum up, make the folder titles and bookmarks searchable at the same time!\nThe resulting list should return folders and bookmarks that contain the search\nstring anywhere in their title/name/location/description/tags. Alternatively,\nthe user should be able to jump from one hit to the next hit in the bookmark\ntree as it is implemented in the Netscape Communicator.\n\nIf some user does not want to find folder titles, then the user should be able\nto turn this off.

In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly.

Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."

Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox. Is it possable that\nthis could be included? Pretty please!\n\nI REALLY would LOVE a solution to this Please help....

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage. This will not only serve the purpose mentioned above, but also allow\naccess to the text on the page(for copy/paste etc).

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

Another would be\nto implement [bug\n#255274](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=255274), to have the\ncapability of having a style-sheet control the display format (e.g., line\nspacing, margins, font size). Of course, all this should include making the\nbookmarks file a valid HTML file, including a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.\n\nAnother display bug that should be fixed is\n[#245934](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=245934). The Bookmarks\nManager normalized window size is forgotten if the window was maximized when\nit was closed."

In contrast to Firefox, the old bookmark editor of Netscape\nCommunicator is very fast and convenient. Moving and copying bookmarks between\n(sub)folders is much faster than with Firefox and Mozilla, in particular, on\nSun Solaris. Please learn from the old editors!\n\nIn particular, I have hundreds of folders and subfolders with thousands of\nbookmarks. And the function \"Find in Bookmarks\" of Netscape Communicator\nallows to search for text in bookmarks as well as in folder/subfolder titles\nand to jump from one search hit to the next search hit within the tree.\n\nExample: Using the search string \"Java\", it is very useful to find all\nsubfolders titled \"Java applications/programming/etc.\" contained in diverse\nfolders named \"applications\" and \"programming\".\n\nTo sum up, make the folder titles and bookmarks searchable at the same time!\nThe resulting list should return folders and bookmarks that contain the search\nstring anywhere in their title/name/location/description/tags. Alternatively,\nthe user should be able to jump from one hit to the next hit in the bookmark\ntree as it is implemented in the Netscape Communicator.\n\nIf some user does not want to find folder titles, then the user should be able\nto turn this off.

In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."

Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox. Is it possable that\nthis could be included? Pretty please!\n\nI REALLY would LOVE a solution to this Please help....

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage. This will not only serve the purpose mentioned above, but also allow\naccess to the text on the page(for copy/paste etc).

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

Another would be\nto implement [bug\n#255274](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=255274), to have the\ncapability of having a style-sheet control the display format (e.g., line\nspacing, margins, font size). Of course, all this should include making the\nbookmarks file a valid HTML file, including a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.\n\nAnother display bug that should be fixed is\n[#245934](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=245934). The Bookmarks\nManager normalized window size is forgotten if the window was maximized when\nit was closed."

In contrast to Firefox, the old bookmark editor of Netscape\nCommunicator is very fast and convenient. Moving and copying bookmarks between\n(sub)folders is much faster than with Firefox and Mozilla, in particular, on\nSun Solaris. Please learn from the old editors!\n\nIn particular, I have hundreds of folders and subfolders with thousands of\nbookmarks. And the function \"Find in Bookmarks\" of Netscape Communicator\nallows to search for text in bookmarks as well as in folder/subfolder titles\nand to jump from one search hit to the next search hit within the tree.\n\nExample: Using the search string \"Java\", it is very useful to find all\nsubfolders titled \"Java applications/programming/etc.\" contained in diverse\nfolders named \"applications\" and \"programming\".\n\nTo sum up, make the folder titles and bookmarks searchable at the same time!\nThe resulting list should return folders and bookmarks that contain the search\nstring anywhere in their title/name/location/description/tags. Alternatively,\nthe user should be able to jump from one hit to the next hit in the bookmark\ntree as it is implemented in the Netscape Communicator.\n\nIf some user does not want to find folder titles, then the user should be able\nto turn this off.

In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

The idea is that visually\noriented people --aka designers-- would likely remember a website more by it's\ndesign and appearance than the name or current title of the website that they\nsaw for the split second while they click **OK** on the **Add Bookmark**\nWindow. Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage. This will not only serve the purpose mentioned above, but also allow\naccess to the text on the page(for copy/paste etc). I often bookmark pages\nbecause they contain some useful snippet of information and not because I plan\nto visit them repeatedly. Having a saved copy of the page gives the user\noffline access to the contents on the day the page was bookmarked.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

But it\nmay be better to have two separate interfaces.\n\nThe menu's purpose is fast access to frequently visited websites, also\nreferred to as FAVORITES. In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly. Tagging seems a perfect tool to categorize\nthese bookmarks for the WEB INDEX in a very flexible, quick, and simple way.\nFor more details please see:\n<http://pubnotes.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/rethinking-bookmarks-ui/>"

Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox. Is it possable that\nthis could be included? Pretty please!\n\nI REALLY would LOVE a solution to this Please help....

I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.

Similar use\ncases would be remembering items you are comparing to purchase, funny pages\nyou want to show friends, long articles you are reading, remembering\nconferences or other events that will lose relevance shortly, and remembering\nstories to write a blog entry about.\n\nIn firefox 2 this sort of use is very cumbersome. With 'add bookmark here'\nbookmarks can be added efficently enough but every time one wants to remove\nbookmarks you need to go to the manage bookmark's screen. Some more efficent\nmeans of removing temporary bookmarks is needed, perhaps several. The\nfollowing features all seem good:\n\n1) Expiration times for bookmarks, when created you can specify a date on\nwhich the bookmark will be deleted/become invisible.\n\n2) Folder based expiration times, particular folders could time out bookmarks\nwhen they age past a certain date.\n\n3) Most recently used display with bookmarks disappearing after they fall\nbelow some threshold.\n\n4) The above but at the user's request.\n\n5) Easy option to delete without entering the organize bookmarks page.\n\nOf course all of these really need appropriate sort option.\n\n    \n\n    How about a special tag called \"temp\" that only keeps things for one or two days?\n    How about a tag \"new\" that is removed as soon as you click on it?\n    How about per-tag expiry rules?\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:12, 7 June 2007 (PDT)"

In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly. Tagging seems a perfect tool to categorize\nthese bookmarks for the WEB INDEX in a very flexible, quick, and simple way.\nFor more details please see:\n<http://pubnotes.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/rethinking-bookmarks-ui/>"

Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox. Is it possable that\nthis could be included? Pretty please!\n\nI REALLY would LOVE a solution to this Please help....

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything.

A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage. This will not only serve the purpose mentioned above, but also allow\naccess to the text on the page(for copy/paste etc). I often bookmark pages\nbecause they contain some useful snippet of information and not because I plan\nto visit them repeatedly.

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

In contrast to Firefox, the old bookmark editor of Netscape\nCommunicator is very fast and convenient. Moving and copying bookmarks between\n(sub)folders is much faster than with Firefox and Mozilla, in particular, on\nSun Solaris. Please learn from the old editors!\n\nIn particular, I have hundreds of folders and subfolders with thousands of\nbookmarks. And the function \"Find in Bookmarks\" of Netscape Communicator\nallows to search for text in bookmarks as well as in folder/subfolder titles\nand to jump from one search hit to the next search hit within the tree.\n\nExample: Using the search string \"Java\", it is very useful to find all\nsubfolders titled \"Java applications/programming/etc.\" contained in diverse\nfolders named \"applications\" and \"programming\".\n\nTo sum up, make the folder titles and bookmarks searchable at the same time!\nThe resulting list should return folders and bookmarks that contain the search\nstring anywhere in their title/name/location/description/tags. Alternatively,\nthe user should be able to jump from one hit to the next hit in the bookmark\ntree as it is implemented in the Netscape Communicator.\n\nIf some user does not want to find folder titles, then the user should be able\nto turn this off.

In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly. Tagging seems a perfect tool to categorize\nthese bookmarks for the WEB INDEX in a very flexible, quick, and simple way.\nFor more details please see:\n<http://pubnotes.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/rethinking-bookmarks-ui/>"

Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."

Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox. Is it possable that\nthis could be included? Pretty please!\n\nI REALLY would LOVE a solution to this Please help....

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage. This will not only serve the purpose mentioned above, but also allow\naccess to the text on the page(for copy/paste etc).

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

Another would be\nto implement [bug\n#255274](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=255274), to have the\ncapability of having a style-sheet control the display format (e.g., line\nspacing, margins, font size). Of course, all this should include making the\nbookmarks file a valid HTML file, including a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.\n\nAnother display bug that should be fixed is\n[#245934](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=245934). The Bookmarks\nManager normalized window size is forgotten if the window was maximized when\nit was closed."

In contrast to Firefox, the old bookmark editor of Netscape\nCommunicator is very fast and convenient. Moving and copying bookmarks between\n(sub)folders is much faster than with Firefox and Mozilla, in particular, on\nSun Solaris. Please learn from the old editors!\n\nIn particular, I have hundreds of folders and subfolders with thousands of\nbookmarks. And the function \"Find in Bookmarks\" of Netscape Communicator\nallows to search for text in bookmarks as well as in folder/subfolder titles\nand to jump from one search hit to the next search hit within the tree.\n\nExample: Using the search string \"Java\", it is very useful to find all\nsubfolders titled \"Java applications/programming/etc.\" contained in diverse\nfolders named \"applications\" and \"programming\".\n\nTo sum up, make the folder titles and bookmarks searchable at the same time!\nThe resulting list should return folders and bookmarks that contain the search\nstring anywhere in their title/name/location/description/tags. Alternatively,\nthe user should be able to jump from one hit to the next hit in the bookmark\ntree as it is implemented in the Netscape Communicator.\n\nIf some user does not want to find folder titles, then the user should be able\nto turn this off.

In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly. Tagging seems a perfect tool to categorize\nthese bookmarks for the WEB INDEX in a very flexible, quick, and simple way.\nFor more details please see:\n<http://pubnotes.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/rethinking-bookmarks-ui/>"

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."

Now I know that Firefox has a \"Bookmark All Tabs...\" option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to \"open in tabs\" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The \"Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs\" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox. Is it possable that\nthis could be included? Pretty please!\n\nI REALLY would LOVE a solution to this Please help....

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Another reason for visual bookmarks is when people are use to a\nwebsite for it's design and have stopped visiting it regularly for a while,\nand when they are fumbling through their bookmarks looking for it again it may\nhave changed it's design. With **Visual Bookmarks** , a screen capture could\nbe made of the old design to help them realize that what they are looking for\nwell, isn't anymore.\n\nTo implement it there should be an array of options like file format,\nscreenshot dimensions, history, and update interval. File format/saving\noptions are self explanitory and really a high quality JPEG or PNG would be\nbest. The dimensions of the screenshot would be equivilent to setting the\ninner part of the window to exactly 900x900 or 3600x800 and taking the inner\nscreenshot from there; assuming they entered 900x900 or 3600x800, it could be\nanything. It is important that they are NOT setting the window size as menu\nbars etc would be variable between clients and frivilous. A screenshot history\noption are how many out of date screenshots to keep, perhaps a redesign\nlocator which could compare screen shot similarities to detect a design\nchange, but that is probably FAR to ambitious. The update interval would be\nthe frequency screenshots are to be updated, set globally and per screenshot.\n\nThe output of these screenshots would appear perhaps when a bookmark is\nhovered over or in the **Manage Bookmarks...** window.\n\nAlternatively, the page itself could be saved as an html file instead of an\nimage. This will not only serve the purpose mentioned above, but also allow\naccess to the text on the page(for copy/paste etc).

That's pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward \"User:Mikelward\") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.

What I would\nlike to do is make any selection of bookmarks in the Manager, and be able to\nsort them alphabetically, once and for all, Sorted view or not. Being able to\nsort an entire folder without first having to make a (rather huge, in some\ncases) selection would also help, but this alone is not enough.

Another would be\nto implement [bug\n#255274](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=255274), to have the\ncapability of having a style-sheet control the display format (e.g., line\nspacing, margins, font size). Of course, all this should include making the\nbookmarks file a valid HTML file, including a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.\n\nAnother display bug that should be fixed is\n[#245934](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=245934). The Bookmarks\nManager normalized window size is forgotten if the window was maximized when\nit was closed."

In contrast to Firefox, the old bookmark editor of Netscape\nCommunicator is very fast and convenient. Moving and copying bookmarks between\n(sub)folders is much faster than with Firefox and Mozilla, in particular, on\nSun Solaris. Please learn from the old editors!\n\nIn particular, I have hundreds of folders and subfolders with thousands of\nbookmarks. And the function \"Find in Bookmarks\" of Netscape Communicator\nallows to search for text in bookmarks as well as in folder/subfolder titles\nand to jump from one search hit to the next search hit within the tree.\n\nExample: Using the search string \"Java\", it is very useful to find all\nsubfolders titled \"Java applications/programming/etc.\" contained in diverse\nfolders named \"applications\" and \"programming\".\n\nTo sum up, make the folder titles and bookmarks searchable at the same time!\nThe resulting list should return folders and bookmarks that contain the search\nstring anywhere in their title/name/location/description/tags. Alternatively,\nthe user should be able to jump from one hit to the next hit in the bookmark\ntree as it is implemented in the Netscape Communicator.\n\nIf some user does not want to find folder titles, then the user should be able\nto turn this off.

In principle, its function is similar to program\nmenus or to sidebars with a small number of items. In contrast to the function\nof favorites, there is a large number of bookmarks that have been saved\nbecause they were interesting or valuable. This personal WEB INDEX is a\n\"permanent history\" of marked websites. Searching this INDEX can provide pre-\nselected information very quickly.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging. Create an option to export\neither subfolders or bookmarks with certain tags into a portable XML file that\ncan then be imported elsewhere."

I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of \"bookmarks,\" stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don't want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn't want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or 'onClose' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx. Looks like\n[synch2it](http://www.sync2it.com/b2/index.php) has done more development on\nthe client and server side, too - features from here should give good ideas.\nThe #1 most important bookmarking feature for me is when I need to synch\nbookmarks between my home computers, my work computers, and my laptop, and\nextra nice if I can get to them when I'm an internet cafe.\n\nBeing able to specify a particular bookmark folder to point to a particular\nfile on a WebDAV server would be useful. The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it! You should be able to edit your bookmarks\nthrough Firefox as per usual, and then an extension or something would\nsilently sync your bookmarks with a server somewhere. This way no matter where\nyou go you could always have your same bookmarks available to you. Also, on\nthe idea of making your bookmarks publicly available, all you would need to do\nis add a little locked/unlocked button besides each bookmark to control which\nones are public and private."

Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page's Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. \"IE + hacks + 4stars\")--even through he doesn't recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager's\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages. (naowro)\n\n### Mac-Compatibile Shortcuts in Bookmark Manager\n\nAdd support for command-deleting (the standard Mac shortcut for \"delete\nselection\") of bookmarks and folders in Bookmark Manager."
