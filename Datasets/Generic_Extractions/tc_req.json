These are generic base types into which any player should fall. These\nare defined in the Bluetooth Assigned Numbers. The types distinguish between players which are liable to\nneed to be controlled in different manners, for example, a pause command may not be accepted on a\nbroadcasting player. These are represented by a bitmask, so a player may fall into more than one of\nthese major types. Note that it is up to each player to advertise itself appropriately for user\u2019s convenience.\n\n\nTo allow further differentiation to be performed subtypes are defined. These are defined in the Bluetooth\nAssigned numbers. There are two defined subtypes, Audio Book player and Podcast player. Future\nsubtypes may be defined in the Bluetooth Assigned Numbers. These are both subtypes of the audio\nplayer type. This field is also a bitmask.\n\n\nThe Play Status field can be used by the CT to learn which players are currently playing without having to\nswitch the Addressed Player between all players to explicitly request each player\u2019s status separately\n(Note that on some TGs, switching the Addressed Player might result in stopping a player\u2019s audio\nstream).\n\n\nEach Player on a TG announces its features to the CT in the PlayerFeatureBitmask.

It is expected that the audio sink will perform as the TG\nfor this command.\n\n\nAs this command specifies a percentage rather than an absolute dB level, the CT should exercise caution\nwhen sending this command.\n\n\nIt should be noted that this command is intended to alter the rendering volume on the audio sink. It is not\nintended to alter the volume within the audio stream.\n\n\nThe volume level which has actually been set on the TG is returned in the response.\n\n\nNote that because the TG and CT will have a different way to display the volume control to the user, the\nnumber of discrete volume steps on the CT and TG will frequently be different when changing between 0\npercent and 100 percent. Therefore, a TG can return a volume level that is different from the level\nrequested in the command parameters. For example, the TG might have a coarse granularity of volume\ncontrol and engage a level near the requested level, or the TG might enforce a maximum volume limit\nbased on a device policy, or the TG might be handling a concurrent and conflicting volume change\noriginating from its own device user interface or another CT.\n\n\nWhen the volume is changed on the TG by this command, the Volume Change notification shall not be\ncompleted.\n\n\nThe Set Absolute Volume command is transported as an AV/C Control command. The command and\nresponse parameters are given in Section 6.13.2.1 and Section 6.13.2.2.\n\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **93 of 170**\n\n\n**Audio/Video Remote Control Profile /** Profile Specification\n\n\nAn example PDU is given in Section 24.16."

The TG should provide the available attribute values in the response. The TG is not\nrequired to provide a value for all requested attributes.\n\n\nThe CT should not issue a GetFolderItems command to an empty folder.

This\nmay occur if the application on the TG changes, or the application changes mode, for instance, different\nfunctionality may be available when the TG is playing locally stored audio tracks to when it is acting as a\nradio. How this is handled by the CT is implementation dependent. If the TG application changes to\nsupport less functionality, the CT may receive error responses indicating that the function requested is not\nimplemented. The CT may then decide to reissue the GetCapabilities to get the most current capabilities.\nIf the TG application changes to support more features, the CT may be happy to continue using the\noriginal set of features supported. If not, it may choose to occasionally poll the TG with a GetCapabilities\nto determine when further capabilities are available.\n\n###### **Player application settings PDUs**\n\n\nThe following PDUs provide the needed functionality for controller devices to access and set attribute\nvalue on the target device."
