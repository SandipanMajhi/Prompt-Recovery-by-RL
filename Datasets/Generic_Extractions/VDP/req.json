        "content": "The Video Distribution Profile (VDP) defines the protocols and procedures that realize\ndistribution of video content, using ACL channels. A typical usage case is streaming of\nvideo content from an observation camera to a monitor. The Video data is compressed\nin a specific format for efficient use of the limited bandwidth.\n\nVDP focuses on video streaming, while the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)\n\n[2] specifies high quality audio streaming. Support of both profiles enables the\ndistribution of video content accompanied with high-quality audio. The usage of video\nand audio streaming is described in Appendix B. VDP does not include remote control\nfunctions, and uses same transport architecture as A2DP (i.e. AVDTP [5] over L2CAP\n\n[1]). Devices may support remote control features on Bluetooth by implementing both\nVDP and the control profile as depicted, for example, in the usage scenario of\nAudio/Video Remote Control Profile [3].\n\n_Note1_ : VDP supports vendor specific extension to facilitate transport of multimedia\ncontent as a pre-multiplexed stream of audio and video. The multiplexing is performed\non application level.\n\n### **1.2 Profile Dependency**\n\nIn Figure 1.1, the structure and the dependencies of the profiles are depicted. A profile\nis dependent upon another profile if it re-uses parts of that profile, by implicitly or\nexplicitly referencing it. Dependency is illustrated in the figure. A profile has\ndependencies on the profile(s) in which it is contained – directly and indirectly.\n\nAs indicated in the figure, the VDP is dependent upon the Generic Access Profile (GAP),\nand also the Generic Audio/Video Distribution Profile (GAVDP) [4] that defines\nprocedures required to setup an audio/video streaming. The VDP defines parameters\nand procedures that are specific for video streaming. The terminology, user interface\nand procedures as defined in the GAP and GAVDP are applicable to this profile, unless\nexplicitly stated otherwise.\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 11 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\n### **1.3 Symbols and Conventions**"

AVDTP [5] consists of a signaling entity for negotiation of\nstreaming parameters and a transport entity that can handle streaming itself.\n\nThe Application layer shown in Figure 2.1 is the entity in which the device can set\napplication service and transport service parameters. The entity also adapts the video\nstreaming data into/from the defined packet format.\n\nFor the shaded protocols/entities in Figure 2.1, the GAVDP applies, except in those\ncases where this profile explicitly states deviations.\n\n### **2.2 Configurations and Roles**\n\nThe following roles are defined for devices that implement this profile:\n\n**Source (SRC) –** A device is the **SRC** when it acts as a source of a digital video stream\nthat is delivered to the **SNK** of the piconet.\n\n**Sink (SNK) –** A device is the **SNK** when it acts as a sink of a digital video stream\ndelivered from the **SRC** on the same piconet.\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 14 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\nExamples of configurations illustrating the roles for this profile are depicted in Figure 2.2.\n\n### **2.3 User Requirements and Scenarios**\n\nThe following scenario is covered by this profile:\n\n- Setup/control/manipulate a streaming of video or pre-multiplexed audio and video\ndata from the **SRC** to the **SNK** (s).\n\nThe following restrictions are applied to this profile:\n\n1. The profile does not support a synchronized point-to-multipoint distribution.\n\n2. There exists certain delay between the **SRC** and the **SNK** due to radio signal\n\nprocessing, data buffering, and encode/decode of the stream data. Countering the\neffects of such delays depends on implementation.\n\nThe following requirements are set in this profile:\n\n1. The required media stream (or pre-multiplexed audio and video) data rate shall be\n\nlimited to allow packet retransmissions on the Bluetooth data link. Using packet\nretransmission will reduce the effects of packet loss, and improve the user\nexperience.\n\n2. The profile does not exclude any content protection method.\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 15 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\n### **2.4 Profile Fundamentals**\n\nThe profile fundamentals are same as defined in the GAVDP in addition to the following\nrequirement.\n\n- Content Protection is provided at the application level and is not a function of the\nBluetooth link level security protocol.\n\n### **2.5 Conformance**\n\nWhen conformance to this profile is claimed, all capabilities indicated mandatory for this\nprofile shall be supported in the specified manner (process mandatory). This also\napplies for optional and conditional capabilities for which support is indicated. All\nmandatory, optional, and conditional capabilities, for which support is indicated, are\nsubject to verification as part of the Bluetooth certification program.\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 16 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\n## **3 Application Layer**\n\nThis section describes the feature requirements on units complying with the VDP.\n\nTable 3.1 shows the feature requirements for this profile.\n\n|Item<br>No.|Feature|Support in<br>SRC|Support in<br>SNK|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|Video Streaming|M|M|\n\nTable 3.2 maps each feature to the procedures used for that feature, and shows\nwhether the procedure is optional, mandatory, or conditional. The procedures are\ndescribed in the reference section.\n\n|Item<br>No.|Feature|Procedure|Ref.|Support<br>in SRC|Support<br>in SNK|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|Video Streaming|Send Video Stream|3.2.1|M|N/A|\n|||Receive Video Stream|3.2.2|N/A|M|\n\n### **3.1 Video Streaming Set Up**\n\nWhen a device wishes to start streaming of video or pre-multiplexed audio and video\ncontent, the device firstly needs to set up a streaming connection. Signaling procedures\nand typical signaling flows are illustrated in Section 4.1 and Appendix A of GAVDP [4],\nrespectively. During such set-up procedure, the devices select the most suitable video\nor pre-multiplexed audio and video streaming parameters. There are two kinds of\nservices configured; one is an application service capability, and the other is a transport\nservice capability. (For details, see Section 6.6 in AVDTP [5].) This profile specifies\nvideo and pre-multiplexed audio and video specific parameters necessary for these\nsignaling procedures.\n\nThe application service capability for VDP consists of video codec capability, multimedia\ncodec capability and content protection capability. Details of these parameters such as\nmode, frame rate, and bit rate are described in Section 4. The content protection\ncapability is described in Appendix A as informative.\n\nThe transport service capability is to select the services provided by AVDTP in order to\nmanipulate the streaming packets more intelligently. Such treatment will help effective\nuse of bandwidth. Available modes, parameters and their requirements are explained in\nSection 5.1.\n\n### **3.2 Video Streaming**\n\nOnce streaming connection is established and _Start Streaming_ procedure in GAVDP is\nexecuted, both SRC and SNK are in the STREAMING state, in which the SRC (SNK) is\nready to send (receive) video stream. (See Section 4.1 in GAVDP.) The SRC uses the\n_Send Video Stream_ procedure to send video data to the SNK, which in turn employs the\n_Receive Video Stream_ procedure to receive the video data. The block diagram of these\nprocedures and created packet format are shown in\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 17 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\nFigure 3.1. In section 4, video-specific parameters in AVDTP header and media payload\nformat are also specified.\n\nNote again that the devices shall be in the STREAMING state to send/receive video\nstream. If the **SRC** / **SNK** wishes to send/receive the video stream whereas the state is\nstill at OPEN, the **SRC** / **SNK** shall initiate _Start Streaming_ procedure defined in GAVDP."

Specifically, AVDTP provides\nfor the identification and negotiation of a particular content protection method via the\n_Get All Capabilities_ and _Stream Configuration_ procedures.\n\nThe _Security Control_ procedure in AVDTP provides for the exchange of the activated\ncontent protection method.\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 38 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\n## **13 Appendix B (Informative): Video Streaming with High** **quality Audio**\n\nThis section contains an example of typical signaling procedures defined in AVDTP for\naudio and video streaming set up. The audio streaming is defined in A2DP [2]. This\nsection is informative only. For details, refer to GAVDP [4] and AVDTP [5]. In this\nexample, the **SRC** of audio stream and video stream is assumed to be the **INT**, while\nthe **SNK** to be the **ACP** .\n\n### **13.1 Audio and Video Streaming Set Up**\n\n**SRC** device supports two _Stream Endpoints_ (SEP1 and SEP2). SEP1 is the source of\naudio and SEP2 is the source of video. **SNK** device also supports two _Stream_\n_Endpoints_ (SEP1 and SEP2). SEP1 is the sink of audio and SEP2 is the sink of video.\n\nThe initial states of the both devices are <IDLE>.\n\nThe **SRC** initiates _Stream Endpoint (SEP) Discovery_ procedure. This procedure serves\nto return the media type and SEID for each stream end-point. The **SRC** finds the audiotype SEP (SEP1) and video-type SEP (SEP2) in the **SNK** .\n\nThen, _Get All Capabilities_ procedure is initiated to collect service capabilities of these\ntwo SEPs in the **SNK** . There are two kinds of service capabilities; one is an application\nservice capability and the other is a transport service capability. The application service\ncapability of SEP1 consists of audio codec capability and content protection capability.\nThe application service capability of SEP2 consists of video codec capability and\ncontent protection capability. Regarding the transport service capability, refer to Section\n5.4 in AVDTP [5].\n\nBased on collected SEP information and service capabilities, the **SRC** determines the\nmost suitable audio streaming parameters (codec, content protection and transport\nservice) for SEP1 in the **SNK** and video streaming parameters (codec, content\nprotection and transport service) for SEP2 in the **SNK** . Then, the **SRC** requests the\n**SNK** to configure the audio streaming parameters of SEP1 and video streaming\nparameters of SEP2 in the **SNK** by using the _Stream_ _Configuration_ procedure. The **SRC**\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 39 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\nalso configures the audio streaming parameters of SEP1 and video streaming\nparameters of SEP2 in it.\n\nThen, L2CAP channels for both audio and video streams are established as defined in\nthe _Stream_ _Establishment_ procedure. The **SRC** establishes the L2CAP channels\nbetween SEP1 in the **SRC** and SEP1 in the **SNK** for audio streaming, and also\nestablishes the L2CAP channels between SEP2 in the **SRC** and SEP2 in the **SNK** for\nvideo streaming. Finally, the states of both devices are set at <OPEN>.\n\n### **13.2 Audio and Video Streaming Procedure**\n\nThe **SRC** initiates _Start Streaming_ procedure by a user initiated action or an internal\nevent. This procedure indicates the **SNK** to start to send the audio stream from SEP1\nand the video stream from SEP2 in the **SRC** . The states of both devices are changed\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 40 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\nfrom <OPEN> to <STREAMING>. Audio and video streaming is started after this\nprocedure is completed.\n\n### **13.3 Media Synchronization**\n\nThere are some A/V applications that require the media synchronization between audio\nand video streams. The Delay Reporting Feature defined by AVDTP [5] (used for the\ntransport protocol of both A2DP and VDP) can provide the function of media\nsynchronization.\n\nThe Basic Service specifies the media packet format that contains the time stamp field\nin its header area. The time stamp value is used to indicate the sampling instant of the\nfirst octet in the media packet from the **SRC** to the **SNK** . However, the value of the time\nstamp is added by the transport protocol, and it is independent from the wall clock value\nof the **SRC** .\n\nThe Reporting Service specifies the Sender Report Reporting packet to indicate some\ntransport service information of the corresponding media stream from the **SRC** to the\n**SNK** . The Sender Report Reporting packet contains NTP [14] Time Stamp to indicate\nthe wall clock value of the **SRC,** and RTP [15] Time Stamp to indicate the time stamp\nvalue in the media packet corresponding to the above NTP [14] Time Stamp value. The\ndifference between the NTP[14] Time Stamp value and RTP [15] Time Stamp value in\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 41 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\nthe Sender Report Reporting packet for the audio stream indicates the difference\nbetween the wall clock value and the time stamp value in the media packet of audio\nstream. It is the same for the video stream.\n\nBy using above mechanisms, when the **SNK** receives the media packets of audio\nstream and video stream from the **SRC**, the **SNK** can estimate the real sampling time of\nthe first octet in the received media packets of audio stream and video stream. The\n**SNK** can then render synchronized audio and video.\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 42 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\n## **14 Appendix C: Acronyms and Abbreviations**\n\n|Acronym|Description|\n|---|---|\n|A/V|Audio/Video|\n|A2DP|Advanced Audio Distribution Profile|\n|ACP|Acceptor|\n|AVDTP|Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol|\n|AVRCP|Audio/Video Remote Control Profile|\n|CP_Type|Content Protection Type|\n|CRC|Cyclic Redundancy Check|\n|GAP|Generic Access Profile|\n|GAVDP|Generic Audio/Video Distribution Profile|\n|ICS|Implementation Conformance Statement|\n|IETF|Internet Engineering Task Force|\n|INT|Initiator|\n|LC|Link Controller|\n|LM|Link Manager|\n|LSB|Least Significant Bit (Byte)|\n|MPEG|Moving Picture Expert Group|\n|MSB|Most Significant Bit (Byte)|\n|MTU|Maximum Transmission Unit|\n|NTP|Network Time Protocol|\n|PSM|Protocol/Service Multiplexer|\n|QoS|Quality of Service|\n|RFA|Reserved for Future Additions|\n|RFD|Reserved for Future Definition|\n|RTP|Real-time Transport Protocol|\n|SDP|Service Discovery Protocol|\n|SNK|Sink|\n|SRC|Source|\n|TSS|Test Suite Structure|\n|VDP|Video Distribution Profile|"

AVDTP [5] consists of a signaling entity for negotiation of\nstreaming parameters and a transport entity that can handle streaming itself.\n\nThe Application layer shown in Figure 2.1 is the entity in which the device can set\napplication service and transport service parameters. The entity also adapts the video\nstreaming data into/from the defined packet format.\n\nFor the shaded protocols/entities in Figure 2.1, the GAVDP applies, except in those\ncases where this profile explicitly states deviations.\n\n### **2.2 Configurations and Roles**\n\nThe following roles are defined for devices that implement this profile:\n\n**Source (SRC) –** A device is the **SRC** when it acts as a source of a digital video stream\nthat is delivered to the **SNK** of the piconet.\n\n**Sink (SNK) –** A device is the **SNK** when it acts as a sink of a digital video stream\ndelivered from the **SRC** on the same piconet.\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 14 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\nExamples of configurations illustrating the roles for this profile are depicted in Figure 2.2.\n\n### **2.3 User Requirements and Scenarios**\n\nThe following scenario is covered by this profile:\n\n- Setup/control/manipulate a streaming of video or pre-multiplexed audio and video\ndata from the **SRC** to the **SNK** (s).\n\nThe following restrictions are applied to this profile:\n\n1. The profile does not support a synchronized point-to-multipoint distribution.\n\n2. There exists certain delay between the **SRC** and the **SNK** due to radio signal\n\nprocessing, data buffering, and encode/decode of the stream data. Countering the\neffects of such delays depends on implementation.\n\nThe following requirements are set in this profile:\n\n1. The required media stream (or pre-multiplexed audio and video) data rate shall be\n\nlimited to allow packet retransmissions on the Bluetooth data link. Using packet\nretransmission will reduce the effects of packet loss, and improve the user\nexperience.\n\n2. The profile does not exclude any content protection method.\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 15 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\n### **2.4 Profile Fundamentals**\n\nThe profile fundamentals are same as defined in the GAVDP in addition to the following\nrequirement.\n\n- Content Protection is provided at the application level and is not a function of the\nBluetooth link level security protocol.\n\n### **2.5 Conformance**\n\nWhen conformance to this profile is claimed, all capabilities indicated mandatory for this\nprofile shall be supported in the specified manner (process mandatory). This also\napplies for optional and conditional capabilities for which support is indicated. All\nmandatory, optional, and conditional capabilities, for which support is indicated, are\nsubject to verification as part of the Bluetooth certification program.\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 16 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\n## **3 Application Layer**\n\nThis section describes the feature requirements on units complying with the VDP.\n\nTable 3.1 shows the feature requirements for this profile.\n\n|Item<br>No.|Feature|Support in<br>SRC|Support in<br>SNK|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|Video Streaming|M|M|\n\nTable 3.2 maps each feature to the procedures used for that feature, and shows\nwhether the procedure is optional, mandatory, or conditional. The procedures are\ndescribed in the reference section.\n\n|Item<br>No.|Feature|Procedure|Ref.|Support<br>in SRC|Support<br>in SNK|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|Video Streaming|Send Video Stream|3.2.1|M|N/A|\n|||Receive Video Stream|3.2.2|N/A|M|\n\n### **3.1 Video Streaming Set Up**\n\nWhen a device wishes to start streaming of video or pre-multiplexed audio and video\ncontent, the device firstly needs to set up a streaming connection. Signaling procedures\nand typical signaling flows are illustrated in Section 4.1 and Appendix A of GAVDP [4],\nrespectively. During such set-up procedure, the devices select the most suitable video\nor pre-multiplexed audio and video streaming parameters. There are two kinds of\nservices configured; one is an application service capability, and the other is a transport\nservice capability. (For details, see Section 6.6 in AVDTP [5].) This profile specifies\nvideo and pre-multiplexed audio and video specific parameters necessary for these\nsignaling procedures.\n\nThe application service capability for VDP consists of video codec capability, multimedia\ncodec capability and content protection capability. Details of these parameters such as\nmode, frame rate, and bit rate are described in Section 4. The content protection\ncapability is described in Appendix A as informative.\n\nThe transport service capability is to select the services provided by AVDTP in order to\nmanipulate the streaming packets more intelligently. Such treatment will help effective\nuse of bandwidth. Available modes, parameters and their requirements are explained in\nSection 5.1.\n\n### **3.2 Video Streaming**\n\nOnce streaming connection is established and _Start Streaming_ procedure in GAVDP is\nexecuted, both SRC and SNK are in the STREAMING state, in which the SRC (SNK) is\nready to send (receive) video stream. (See Section 4.1 in GAVDP.) The SRC uses the\n_Send Video Stream_ procedure to send video data to the SNK, which in turn employs the\n_Receive Video Stream_ procedure to receive the video data. The block diagram of these\nprocedures and created packet format are shown in\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 17 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\nFigure 3.1. In section 4, video-specific parameters in AVDTP header and media payload\nformat are also specified.\n\nNote again that the devices shall be in the STREAMING state to send/receive video\nstream. If the **SRC** / **SNK** wishes to send/receive the video stream whereas the state is\nstill at OPEN, the **SRC** / **SNK** shall initiate _Start Streaming_ procedure defined in GAVDP."

Specifically, AVDTP provides\nfor the identification and negotiation of a particular content protection method via the\n_Get All Capabilities_ and _Stream Configuration_ procedures.\n\nThe _Security Control_ procedure in AVDTP provides for the exchange of the activated\ncontent protection method.\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 38 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\n## **13 Appendix B (Informative): Video Streaming with High** **quality Audio**\n\nThis section contains an example of typical signaling procedures defined in AVDTP for\naudio and video streaming set up. The audio streaming is defined in A2DP [2]. This\nsection is informative only. For details, refer to GAVDP [4] and AVDTP [5]. In this\nexample, the **SRC** of audio stream and video stream is assumed to be the **INT**, while\nthe **SNK** to be the **ACP** .\n\n### **13.1 Audio and Video Streaming Set Up**\n\n**SRC** device supports two _Stream Endpoints_ (SEP1 and SEP2). SEP1 is the source of\naudio and SEP2 is the source of video. **SNK** device also supports two _Stream_\n_Endpoints_ (SEP1 and SEP2). SEP1 is the sink of audio and SEP2 is the sink of video.\n\nThe initial states of the both devices are <IDLE>.\n\nThe **SRC** initiates _Stream Endpoint (SEP) Discovery_ procedure. This procedure serves\nto return the media type and SEID for each stream end-point. The **SRC** finds the audiotype SEP (SEP1) and video-type SEP (SEP2) in the **SNK** .\n\nThen, _Get All Capabilities_ procedure is initiated to collect service capabilities of these\ntwo SEPs in the **SNK** . There are two kinds of service capabilities; one is an application\nservice capability and the other is a transport service capability. The application service\ncapability of SEP1 consists of audio codec capability and content protection capability.\nThe application service capability of SEP2 consists of video codec capability and\ncontent protection capability. Regarding the transport service capability, refer to Section\n5.4 in AVDTP [5].\n\nBased on collected SEP information and service capabilities, the **SRC** determines the\nmost suitable audio streaming parameters (codec, content protection and transport\nservice) for SEP1 in the **SNK** and video streaming parameters (codec, content\nprotection and transport service) for SEP2 in the **SNK** . Then, the **SRC** requests the\n**SNK** to configure the audio streaming parameters of SEP1 and video streaming\nparameters of SEP2 in the **SNK** by using the _Stream_ _Configuration_ procedure. The **SRC**\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 39 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\nalso configures the audio streaming parameters of SEP1 and video streaming\nparameters of SEP2 in it.\n\nThen, L2CAP channels for both audio and video streams are established as defined in\nthe _Stream_ _Establishment_ procedure. The **SRC** establishes the L2CAP channels\nbetween SEP1 in the **SRC** and SEP1 in the **SNK** for audio streaming, and also\nestablishes the L2CAP channels between SEP2 in the **SRC** and SEP2 in the **SNK** for\nvideo streaming. Finally, the states of both devices are set at <OPEN>.\n\n### **13.2 Audio and Video Streaming Procedure**\n\nThe **SRC** initiates _Start Streaming_ procedure by a user initiated action or an internal\nevent. This procedure indicates the **SNK** to start to send the audio stream from SEP1\nand the video stream from SEP2 in the **SRC** . The states of both devices are changed\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 40 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\nfrom <OPEN> to <STREAMING>. Audio and video streaming is started after this\nprocedure is completed.\n\n### **13.3 Media Synchronization**\n\nThere are some A/V applications that require the media synchronization between audio\nand video streams. The Delay Reporting Feature defined by AVDTP [5] (used for the\ntransport protocol of both A2DP and VDP) can provide the function of media\nsynchronization.\n\nThe Basic Service specifies the media packet format that contains the time stamp field\nin its header area. The time stamp value is used to indicate the sampling instant of the\nfirst octet in the media packet from the **SRC** to the **SNK** . However, the value of the time\nstamp is added by the transport protocol, and it is independent from the wall clock value\nof the **SRC** .\n\nThe Reporting Service specifies the Sender Report Reporting packet to indicate some\ntransport service information of the corresponding media stream from the **SRC** to the\n**SNK** . The Sender Report Reporting packet contains NTP [14] Time Stamp to indicate\nthe wall clock value of the **SRC,** and RTP [15] Time Stamp to indicate the time stamp\nvalue in the media packet corresponding to the above NTP [14] Time Stamp value. The\ndifference between the NTP[14] Time Stamp value and RTP [15] Time Stamp value in\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 41 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\nthe Sender Report Reporting packet for the audio stream indicates the difference\nbetween the wall clock value and the time stamp value in the media packet of audio\nstream. It is the same for the video stream.\n\nBy using above mechanisms, when the **SNK** receives the media packets of audio\nstream and video stream from the **SRC**, the **SNK** can estimate the real sampling time of\nthe first octet in the received media packets of audio stream and video stream. The\n**SNK** can then render synchronized audio and video.\n\n_BLUETOOTH_ SPECIFICATION Page 42 of 42\n_Video Distribution Profile_\n\n## **14 Appendix C: Acronyms and Abbreviations**\n\n|Acronym|Description|\n|---|---|\n|A/V|Audio/Video|\n|A2DP|Advanced Audio Distribution Profile|\n|ACP|Acceptor|\n|AVDTP|Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol|\n|AVRCP|Audio/Video Remote Control Profile|\n|CP_Type|Content Protection Type|\n|CRC|Cyclic Redundancy Check|\n|GAP|Generic Access Profile|\n|GAVDP|Generic Audio/Video Distribution Profile|\n|ICS|Implementation Conformance Statement|\n|IETF|Internet Engineering Task Force|\n|INT|Initiator|\n|LC|Link Controller|\n|LM|Link Manager|\n|LSB|Least Significant Bit (Byte)|\n|MPEG|Moving Picture Expert Group|\n|MSB|Most Significant Bit (Byte)|\n|MTU|Maximum Transmission Unit|\n|NTP|Network Time Protocol|\n|PSM|Protocol/Service Multiplexer|\n|QoS|Quality of Service|\n|RFA|Reserved for Future Additions|\n|RFD|Reserved for Future Definition|\n|RTP|Real-time Transport Protocol|\n|SDP|Service Discovery Protocol|\n|SNK|Sink|\n|SRC|Source|\n|TSS|Test Suite Structure|\n|VDP|Video Distribution Profile|"
