The PAST procedure is complete when the Broadcast Assistant has sent an\nLL_PERIODIC_SYNC_IND PDU to the Scan Delegator.\n\nIf the Broadcast Assistant has requested the Scan Delegator to synchronize to a PA by writing a value\nof 0x02 (Synchronize to PA \u2013 PAST not available), and if the Broadcast Assistant supports the PAST\nprocedure, the Broadcast Assistant may, upon determining that the Scan Delegator is requesting a\ntransfer of SyncInfo data, transfer SyncInfo data to the Scan Delegator using the PAST procedure. The\nPAST procedure is complete when the Broadcast Assistant has sent an LL_PERIODIC_SYNC_IND PDU\nto the Scan Delegator.\n\nIf the Broadcast Assistant has not requested the Scan Delegator to synchronize to a PA, and if the\nBroadcast Assistant supports the PAST procedure, the Broadcast Assistant may, upon determining\nthat the Scan Delegator is requesting a transfer of SyncInfo data, transfer SyncInfo data to the Scan\nDelegator using the PAST procedure. The PAST procedure is complete when the Broadcast Assistant\nhas sent an LL_PERIODIC_SYNC_IND PDU to the Scan Delegator.\n\nWhen initiating the PAST procedure, the default Broadcast Assistant behavior shall be to write\nan LL_PERIODIC_SYNC_IND PDU AdvA parameter value that matches the AdvA field of the\nADV_EXT_IND PDUs transmitted by the Broadcast Source for the advertising set identified by the\nBroadcast Receive State characteristic used to request a transfer of SyncInfo data. The Broadcast\nAssistant shall only write an LL_PERIODIC_SYNC_IND PDU AdvA parameter value that does not match\nthe ADV_EXT_IND PDU AdvA field, or that does not match the Source_Address field for that Broadcast\nReceive State characteristic if:\n\n- The Broadcast Assistant is aware the AdvA parameter value in the ADV_EXT_IND PDUs for that\nadvertising set has been changed by the Broadcast Source, and/or:\n\n- The AdvA value the Broadcast Assistant wishes to use in the LL_PERIODIC_SYNC_IND PDU is\nderived from the same IRK used to generate both the Resolvable Private Address corresponding to\nthe AdvA parameter value of the ADV_EXT_IND PDU transmitted by the Broadcast Source and the\nResolvable Private Address corresponding to the Source_Address field of the Broadcast Receive State\ncharacteristic.\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **140 of 160**\n\n**Basic Audio Profile** / Profile Specification\n\nThe Broadcast Source should follow the device address recommendations in Section 6.1.3 when\ntransmitting an advertising set that points to a BIG.\n\nIf using HCI to initiate the PAST procedure, the Broadcast Assistant shall write the 2-octet Service_Data\nparameter value with the applicable value defined in Table 6.7 when using the LE Periodic Advertising\nSync Transfer command as defined in Volume 4, Part E, Section 7.8.89 in [1].\n\nWhen initiating the PAST procedure, the Broadcast Assistant shall write the 2-octet ID field of the\nLL_PERIODIC_SYNC_IND PDU CtrData field with the applicable value defined in Table 6.7.\n\n|Octet 0|Octet 1|\n|---|---|\n|Bit 0: AdvA in PAST matches AdvA in ADV_EXT_IND<br>0b0 = Yes, 0b1 = No/Don\u2019t know<br>Bit 1: AdvA in PAST matches Source_Address<br>0b0 = Yes, 0b1 = No/Don\u2019t know<br>All other values: RFU|Source_ID|\n\nData and ID requirements when initiating the PAST procedure_\n\nThe example in Figure 6.14 shows the Scan Delegator requesting a transfer of SyncInfo data from the\nBroadcast Assistant that initiated the Add Source operation in the example in Figure 6.13. The Scan\nDelegator notifies the Broadcast Receive State characteristic to the Broadcast Assistant with a value\nof 0x01 (SyncInfo Request) for the PA_Sync_State field. The Broadcast Assistant then performs Scan\nOffloading by initiating the PAST procedure to transfer the SyncInfo data that the Broadcast Assistant had\npreviously discovered.\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **141 of 160**\n\n**Basic Audio Profile** / Profile Specification"
