Scanning for EA can represent a significant portion of the power budget for a device with limited\nbattery capacity.\n\nScan Delegators can solicit for Broadcast Assistants to scan on behalf of the Scan Delegator for the EA.\nThis helps reduce the need to scan by the Scan Delegator and therefore reduce power consumption on\nthe Scan Delegator; this process is called Remote Broadcast Scanning.\n\nScan Delegators can receive information from Broadcast Assistants that describes BIS, including\ndecryption keys necessary to decrypt encrypted BISes, known as Broadcast_Codes and defined in\nVolume 3, Part C, Section 3.2.6.1 in [1].\n\nScan Delegators can receive transfers of SyncInfo data from Broadcast Assistants; this process is called\nScan Offloading and uses the Periodic Advertising Sync Transfer (PAST) procedure defined in Volume 3,\nPart C, Section 9.5.4 in [1].\n\nDuring Scan Offloading, the Scan Delegator receives the SyncInfo data in LL_PERIODIC_SYNC_IND\nPDUs. The LL_PERIODIC_SYNC_IND PDU is defined in Volume 6, Part B, Section 2.4.2.27 in [1]. Scan\nDelegators can use the SyncInfo data to synchronize to a PA and discover any BASE configuration\ndescribing the broadcast Audio Stream or BIGInfo data carried in the PA that allows the Broadcast Sink\ncollocated with the Scan Delegator to then synchronize to the BIS that transports the broadcast Audio\nStream.\n\nWhen a Broadcast Assistant is collocated with a Broadcast Source, it is possible to use the Broadcast\nAudio Scan Service to communicate information about broadcast Audio Streams transmitted by the\ncollocated Broadcast Source and information about broadcast Audio Streams transmitted by other\nBroadcast Sources.\n\nThe Broadcast Assistant can request the Scan Delegator to add, update, or remove information about\nbroadcast Audio Streams by writing values defined in [6] to the Broadcast Audio Scan Control Point\ncharacteristic.\n\nThe Broadcast Assistant can determine which broadcast Audio Streams the Scan Delegator is aware\nof by reading exposed Broadcast Receive State characteristic values or by receiving notifications of\nBroadcast Receive State characteristic values.\n\nThe Broadcast Assistant support requirements for procedures in this section are defined in Table 6.6.\n\n|Procedure|Section Reference|Requirement|\n|---|---|---|\n|Audio capability discovery|Section 6.5.1|O|\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **133 of 160**\n\n**Basic Audio Profile** / Profile Specification\n\n|Procedure|Col2|Section Reference|Requirement|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Solicitation requests|Solicitation requests|Section 6.5.2|M|\n|Broadcast Audio Scan Control Point opera-<br>tions|Broadcast Audio Scan Control Point opera-<br>tions|–|–|\n||Remote broadcast scanning|Section 6.5.3|O|\n||Adding broadcast sources|Section 6.5.4|O|\n||Modifying broadcast sources|Section 6.5.5|O|\n||SyncInfo transfers|Section 6.5.6|O|\n||Setting Broadcast_Codes|Section 6.5.7|M|\n||Removing broadcast sources|Section 6.5.8|O|"

The Unicast Client\nconfigures codec parameters or uses current codec parameters that are exposed by the Unicast Server.\nThe Unicast Client then configures QoS parameters. The Unicast Client enables an ASE and a CIS and\nmay provide Metadata that is used to describe a unicast Audio Stream or for other purposes.\n\nThe Audio Role for an ASE is determined by the ASE characteristic UUID. A Sink ASE characteristic\nmeans the Unicast Server is in the Audio Sink role for that ASE and the Unicast Client is in the Audio\nSource role for that ASE. A Source ASE characteristic means the Unicast Server is in the Audio Source\nrole for that ASE and the Unicast Client is in the Audio Sink role for that ASE. As described in Section\n2.2 in [6], the term ASE characteristic (or ASE) is used interchangeably for the Sink ASE characteristic (or\nSink ASE) and the Source ASE characteristic (or Source ASE) if the description and/or behavior applies\nequally to both, otherwise the characteristics (or ASEs) are mentioned by name.\n\nWhen an ASE is in the Enabling state, the device in the Audio Sink role for that ASE determines the\ntransition of the ASE to the Streaming state. The Unicast Client and Unicast Server are not prohibited\nfrom transmitting audio data when an ASE is in the Enabling state and a CIS has been established for\nthat ASE, however, there is a risk of lost audio data until the ASE is in the Streaming state because a\nunicast Audio Stream is not established until the ASE is in the Streaming state.\n\nAn ASE is controlled by using the procedures defined in this section.\n\nThe Unicast Client support requirements for procedures in this section are defined in Table 5.1.\n\nRequirements in this section are defined as “Mandatory” (M), “Optional” (O), “Excluded” (X), and\n“Conditional” (C. _n_ ). Conditional requirements (C. _n_ ) are listed directly below the table in which they appear.\n\n|Procedure|Col2|Section Reference|Requirement|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Audio role discovery|Audio role discovery|Section 5.1|M|\n|Audio capability discovery|Audio capability discovery|Section 5.2|O|\n|ASE_ID discovery|ASE_ID discovery|Section 5.3|M|\n|Supported Audio Contexts discovery|Supported Audio Contexts discovery|Section 5.4|O|\n|Available Audio Contexts discovery|Available Audio Contexts discovery|Section 5.4|O|\n|ASE Control operations|ASE Control operations|Section 5.6|–|\n||Codec configuration|Section 5.6.1|M|\n||QoS configuration|Section 5.6.2|M|\n||Enabling an ASE|Section 5.6.3|M|\n||Audio data path setup|Section 5.6.3.1|M|\n||Receiver Start Ready|Section 5.6.3.2|C.1|\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **89 of 160**\n\n**Basic Audio Profile** / Profile Specification\n\n|Procedure|Col2|Section Reference|Requirement|\n|---|---|---|---|\n||Updating Metadata|Section 5.6.4|M|\n||Disabling an ASE|Section 5.6.5|M|\n||Receiver Stop Ready|Section 5.6.5.1|C.1|\n||Releasing an ASE|Section 5.6.6|M|\n||Audio data path removal|Section 5.6.6.1|M|\n||Released ASEs or LE ACL link<br>loss|Section 5.6.7|M|\n||CIS loss|Section 5.6.8|M|\n\nC.1: Mandatory if the Unicast Client supports the Audio Sink role, otherwise Excluded."

The BIG is the group.\n\n- Level 2: Subgroup level. A subgroup is a collection of one or more BISes present in the BIG.\n\n- Level 3: BIS level.\n\nLogically, a group contains one or more subgroups, and a subgroup contains one or more BISes.\n\nA subgroup identifies a set of one or more broadcast Audio Streams intended to be decoded and\npresented simultaneously to a listener. A Broadcast Source organizes BISes that transmit the broadcast\nAudio Streams into one or more subgroups that can be selected by a user, or selected automatically on\nbehalf of the user. For example, a Broadcast Source should create separate subgroups for separate\nprograms, such as different TV channels, or alternative presentations of the same program, such\nas alternative languages (e.g., English, Spanish), mixes (e,g., stereo, mono, multichannel), or other\nalternatives (e.g., dialog-enhanced, director’s commentary). A Broadcast Assistant or Broadcast Sink can\nuse subgroups and the metadata associated with subgroups to populate items in its user interface.\n\nThe codec-specific configuration of a BIS is often very similar to other BISes in the same subgroup, but\ncan have some small differences. For example, the codec configuration for all BISes in a subgroup might\nhave the same sample rate and frame size while each BIS transmits a different Audio Channel. The part\nof the codec-specific configuration that is common for all BISes in a subgroup can be specified in the\nBASE Level 2 data for that subgroup, and the part of the codec-specific configuration that is unique to\na BIS can be specified in the BASE Level 3 data for that BIS. A Broadcast Assistant or Broadcast Sink\nconstructs the complete codec-specific configuration of a BIS according to the rules defined below.\n\nThe following rules shall be met when populating the BASE:\n\n- Rule 1: There shall be at least one subgroup.\n\n- Rule 2: There shall be at least one BIS per subgroup.\n\n- Rule 3: Every BIS in the BIG, denoted by its BIS_index value, shall only be present in one subgroup\n(that is, the sum of Num_BIS[i, j, … _n_ ] is equal to the value of the Num_BIS subfield of the BIGInfo field\nas defined by Volume 6, Part B, Section 4.4.6.3 in [1]).\n\n- Rule 4: Codec_Specific_Configuration parameters shall be present at Level 2 and may be present\nat Level 3. If an identical Codec_Specific_Configuration parameter value is present at Level 2\nand at Level 3, the Codec_Specific_Configuration parameter value at Level 3 shall be treated\nas the only instance of that Codec_Specific_Configuration parameter value present. Where a\nCodec_Specific_Configuration parameter value includes length-type-value (LTV) structures, an LTV\nstructure shall be considered an identical parameter to another LTV structure with the same Type field\nvalue, and the Value field of the LTV structure at Level 3 shall be treated as the only instance of that\nValue field that is present.\n\n- Rule 5: Metadata_Length and Metadata parameter values may be changed while a broadcast Audio\nStream is in the Streaming state (see Section 6.2.1). Changes to any other parameter values shall not\noccur while a broadcast Audio Stream is in the Streaming state.\n\n|Level|Parameter|Size<br>(Octets)|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|\n||Length|1|Length of Type and Value fields for AD data<br>type|\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **38 of 160**\n\n**Basic Audio Profile** / Profile Specification\n\n|Level|Parameter|Col3|Size<br>(Octets)|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n||Type: «Service Data - 16-bit<br>UUID»|Type: «Service Data - 16-bit<br>UUID»|1|Defined in Bluetooth Assigned Numbers[2]|\n||Value|Value|Varies|2-octet Service UUID followed by additional<br>service data|\n|1||Basic Audio Announcement<br>Service UUID|2|Defined in Bluetooth Assigned Numbers[2]|\n|1||Presentation_Delay|3|See Section 7 for description.<br>Range: 0x000000 – 0xFFFFFF<br>Units: µs<br>All other values: RFU|\n|1||Num_Subgroups|1|Number of subgroups used to group BISes<br>present in the BIG<br>Shall be at least 1, as defined by Rule 1|\n|2||Num_BIS[i]|1|Number of BISes in the [ith] subgroup<br>Shall be at least 1, as defined by Rule 2|\n|2||Codec_ID[i]|5|Codec information for the [ith] subgroup<br>Octet 0: Coding Format<br>Coding Format values are defined in the Host<br>Controller Interface section of Bluetooth As-<br>signed Numbers[2].<br>Octet 1–2: Company ID<br>Company identifier values are defined in<br>Bluetooth Assigned Numbers[2].<br>Shall be 0x0000 if octet 0 ≠ 0xFF<br>Octet 3–4: Vendor-specific codec_ID<br>Shall be 0x0000 if octet 0 ≠ 0xFF|\n|2||Codec_Specific_-<br>Configuration_Length[i]|1|Length of the Codec_Specific_Configuration<br>for the [ith] subgroup|\n|2||Codec_Specific_-<br>Configuration[i]|Varies|Codec-specific configuration parameters for<br>the [ith] subgroup<br>Shall exist only if the Codec_Specific_-<br>Configuration_Length[i] ≠ 0x00|\n|2||Metadata_Length[i]|1|Length of the Metadata for the [ith] subgroup|\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **39 of 160**\n\n**Basic Audio Profile** / Profile Specification\n\n|Level|Parameter|Col3|Size<br>(Octets)|Description|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|2||Metadata[i]|Varies|Series of LTV structures containing Metadata<br>for the [ith] subgroup<br>Shall exist only if the Metadata_Length[i] ≠<br>0x00|\n|3||BIS_index[i[k]]|1|BIS_index value for the [kth] BIS in the [ith]<br>subgroup|\n|3||Codec_Specific_-<br>Configuration_Length[i[k]]|1|Length of the Codec_Specific_Configuration<br>for the [kth] BIS in the [ith] subgroup|\n|3||Codec_Specific_-<br>Configuration[i[k]]|Varies|Codec-specific configuration parameters for<br>the [kth] BIS in the [ith] subgroup<br>Shall exist only if the Codec_Specific_-<br>Configuration_Length[i[k]] ≠ 0x00|\n\nA logical example of a BASE structure is shown in Figure 3.1.

The CIS established for ASE_ID[i] and\nASE_ID[j] remains established, however the unicast Audio Streams that were previously established for\nASE_ID[i] and ASE_ID[j] have now been disconnected.\n\n_Source ASE_\n\nIf the Receiver Stop Ready operation has completed successfully for a Source ASE, the Unicast Client\nor the Unicast Server may terminate a CIS established for that Source ASE by following the Connected\nIsochronous Stream Terminate procedure defined in Volume 3, Part C, Section 9.3.15 in [1]. Termination\nof the CIS is not required.\n\nTermination of a bidirectional CIS should not occur if an ASE configured with the CIS_ID for that CIS is in\nthe Enabling state or the Streaming state.\n\nThe Unicast Client and Unicast Server should remove any internal audio data paths that have been set\nup for an ASE as defined in Section 5.6.6.1 before terminating the CIS."
