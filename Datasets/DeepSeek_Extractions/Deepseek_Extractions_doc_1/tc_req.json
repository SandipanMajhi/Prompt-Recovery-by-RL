            "content": "An L2CAP connection establishment for AVCTP control may be initiated by the CT or by the TG. An internal event or an event generated by a user, such as turning the power on, initiates the connection establishment.\n\nIf a browsing channel is supported by both devices, the browsing channel may be established after the control channel. The control channel shall always be established before the browsing channel. It is recommended that the browsing channel is established immediately after the control channel is established to avoid unsatisfactory latency when a browsing command is sent. However, as some use cases involve very occasional use of browsing functionality, devices for which this applies may wish to open the browsing channel on demand to minimize resource usage. The browsing channel shall be configured to use L2CAP Enhanced Retransmission Mode.\n\nIf both devices open an AVCTP channel at the same time, both channels shall be closed and each device shall wait a random time (not more than 1 s and not less than 100ms) and then try to open the AVCTP channel again. If it is known which device is the Central, that device can re-try at once.\n\nNote: Only one L2CAP connection for control and one L2CAP connection for browsing (if supported by both devices) shall be established between AVCTP entities. If the connection(s) already exist(s), the CT/TG shall not initiate the connection request.\n\nFigure 4.1: Connection establishment initiated by CT\n\nFigure 4.2: Connection establishment initiated by TG\n\nFigure 4.3: Control channel establishment initiated by TG and browsing channel establishment initiated by CT when needed."

            "content": "An L2CAP connection establishment for AVCTP control may be initiated by the CT or by the TG. An internal event or an event generated by a user, such as turning the power on, initiates the connection establishment.\n\nIf a browsing channel is supported by both devices, the browsing channel may be established after the control channel. The control channel shall always be established before the browsing channel. It is recommended that the browsing channel is established immediately after the control channel is established to avoid unsatisfactory latency when a browsing command is sent. However, as some use cases involve very occasional use of browsing functionality, devices for which this applies may wish to open the browsing channel on demand to minimize resource usage. The browsing channel shall be configured to use L2CAP Enhanced Retransmission Mode.\n\nIf both devices open an AVCTP channel at the same time, both channels shall be closed and each device shall wait a random time (not more than 1 s and not less than 100ms) and then try to open the AVCTP channel again. If it is known which device is the Central, that device can re-try at once.\n\nNote: Only one L2CAP connection for control and one L2CAP connection for browsing (if supported by both devices) shall be established between AVCTP entities. If the connection(s) already exist(s), the CT/TG shall not initiate the connection request.\n\nFigure 4.1: Connection establishment initiated by CT\n\nFigure 4.2: Connection establishment initiated by TG\n\nFigure 4.3: Control channel establishment initiated by TG and browsing channel establishment initiated by CT when needed."

The control channel shall always be established before the browsing channel. It is recommended that the browsing channel is established immediately after the control channel is established to avoid unsatisfactory latency when a browsing command is sent. However, as some use cases involve very occasional use of browsing functionality, devices for which this applies may wish to open the browsing channel on demand to minimize resource usage. The browsing channel shall be configured to use L2CAP Enhanced Retransmission Mode.\n\nIf both devices open an AVCTP channel at the same time, both channels shall be closed and each device shall wait a random time (not more than 1 s and not less than 100ms) and then try to open the AVCTP channel again. If it is known which device is the Central, that device can re-try at once.\n\nNote: Only one L2CAP connection for control and one L2CAP connection for browsing (if supported by both devices) shall be established between AVCTP entities. If the connection(s) already exist(s), the CT/TG shall not initiate the connection request.\n\nFigure 4.1: Connection establishment initiated by CT\n\nFigure 4.2: Connection establishment initiated by TG\n\nFigure 4.3: Control channel establishment initiated by TG and browsing channel establishment initiated by CT when needed."

This example shows a successful switch to a browsed player with the current directory DEF, which is the child of the folder BC, which itself is the child of the root folder A, which is in the root folder. The folder depth of the root folder is 0.\n\nCT implementers should be aware that some legacy implementations will not allow navigation into the root folder and will only permit the CT to navigate to a minimum folder depth of 1. In this example, the names are in UTF-8. As with other commands, the character set shall only be UTF-8 or a character set which the CT has informed the TG it supports, using the InformDisplayableCharacterSet command (Section 6.5.7).\n\nOn completion of the Set Browsed Player command, the TG shall complete the EVENT_UIDS_CHANGED notification with AV/C CType rejected if it is outstanding.\n\n| MSB | LSB |\n|-----|-----|\n| Status 0x04 | UID Counter \u2013 0x1357 | Number of Items MSB 0x00 |\n| Number of Items LSB 0x000005 | Char Set MSB 0x00 |\n| Char Set LSB 0x6A | Folder Depth 0x03 | Folder Name Length 0x0001 |\n| \u2018A\u2019 0x41 \u2018C\u2019 0x43 \u2018E\u2019 | Name Length 0x0002 | Folder \u2018B\u2019 0x42 |\n| 0x45 | Name Length 0x0003 \u2018F\u2019 | \u2018D\u2019 0x44 |\n| 0x46 |\n\nTable 6.44 Example set browsed player response PDU"

These are generic base types into which any player should fall. These are defined in the Bluetooth Assigned Numbers. The types distinguish between players which are liable to need to be controlled in different manners, for example, a pause command may not be accepted on a broadcasting player. These are represented by a bitmask, so a player may fall into more than one of these major types. Note that it is up to each player to advertise itself appropriately for user\u2019s convenience.\n\nTo allow further differentiation to be performed subtypes are defined. These are defined in the Bluetooth Assigned numbers. There are two defined subtypes, Audio Book player and Podcast player. Future subtypes may be defined in the Bluetooth Assigned Numbers. These are both subtypes of the audio player type. This field is also a bitmask.\n\nThe Play Status field can be used by the CT to learn which players are currently playing without having to switch the Addressed Player between all players to explicitly request each player\u2019s status separately (Note that on some TGs, switching the Addressed Player might result in stopping a player\u2019s audio stream).\n\nEach Player on a TG announces its features to the CT in the PlayerFeatureBitmask. This allows the CT to only offer functions to the user that are available on the current player. Although the SDP record is used to indicate what the AVRCP implementation is capable of supporting this does not mean that all players present on the device have equal capabilities. The Player Feature Bitmask provides finer grained information on the capabilities of a specific player. Because it is player specific it shall be used in preference to the SDP record if the CT requires information about a specific player.\n\nThe Advanced Control Player bit indicates that the player supports AVRCP v1.4 or above. For legacy players below AVRCP v1.4, the PlayerFeatureBitmask shall be handled by the underlying Bluetooth stack that routes the commands to the different players. In that case, the feature bits shall be set to reflect the\n\nsupported Categories and the CT shall be aware that these capabilities only give a hint of the TG features.\n\nItem Type \u2013 1 Octets\n\n| Value | Parameter Description |\n|-------|----------------------|\n| 0x01  | Media Player Item     |\n\nItem Length \u2013 2 Octets\n\n| Value | Parameter Description |\n|-------|----------------------|\n| 0xXXXX| Length of media player item in octets, not including Item Type and Item Length fields. |\n\nPlayer Id \u2013 2 Octets\n\n| Value | Parameter Description |\n|-------|----------------------|\n|  0xXXXX| A unique identifier for this media player. |\n\nMajor Player Type \u2013 1 Octet\n\n| Value | Parameter Description |\n|-------|----------------------|\n| Bit 0 (0x01) | Audio Video Broadcasting Audio Broadcasting |\n| Bit 1 (0x02) | Video Reserved (Additional Major PlayerTypes) |\n| Bit 2 (0x04) | may be defined in Bluetooth Assigned Numbers [6]) |\n| Bit 3 (0x08) | |\n| Bit 4 \u2013 7 | |\n\nPlayer Sub Type \u2013 4 Octets\n\n| Value | Parameter Description |\n|-------|----------------------|\n| Bit 0 (0\u00d700000001) | Audio Book |\n| Bit 1 (0\u00d700000002) | Podcast |\n| Bit 2 - 31 | Reserved (Additional Sub Types may be defined in Bluetooth Assigned Numbers [6]) |\n\nPlay Status \u2013 1 Octet\n\n| Value | Parameter Description |\n|-------|----------------------|\n| 0x00 0x01 | Stopped |\n| 0x02 0x03 | Playing |\n| 0x04 | Paused |\n| 0x05-0xfe | Fwd Seek |\n| 0xff | Rev Seek |\n|       | Reserved |\n|       | Error |\n\n| No. | Parameter Description | Octet | Bit |\n|-----|------------------------|-------|-----|\n| 0   | Select.

The folder depth of the root folder is 0.\n\nCT implementers should be aware that some legacy implementations will not allow navigation into the root folder and will only permit the CT to navigate to a minimum folder depth of 1.

            "content": "Media elements are identified within the virtual filesystem by an 8 octet identifier, the UID. The UID shall be unique within a scope with the exception of the Virtual Media Player Filesystem on database unaware media players as described in Section 6.10.3.1. Scope is defined in Section 6.10.1.2.\n\nWithin the Virtual Media Player Filesystem, a UID uniquely identifies a Media Element Item. If the same Media Element Item is present at more than one location in the Virtual Media Player Filesystem, then it may have the same UID in each location. Within the Now Playing list, a UID uniquely identifies a Media Element Item. If the same Media Element Item is present in more than one location in the Now Playing list, each instance shall have a different UID.\n\nThe value of UID=0x0 is a special value used only to request the metadata for the currently playing media using the GetElementAttributes command and shall not be used for any item in a folder.\n\nThe UID shall be used whenever a media element is required to be identified. For example, it may be used in conjunction with the GettleAttributes command to obtain metadata information about a specific media element, or in combination with ChangePath to change to a specific folder.\n\nThe UID scope is limited to one player, even if that player may have unique UIDs across its virtual filesystem. For example, a media element with the UID 1 in the folder hierarchy for player 1 may be a different media element to that with the UID 1 in the folder hierarchy for player 2.\n\nThere are two different ways a Media Player on a target may handle the UID, depending on the nature of the Media Player: Database Aware (with UID change detection) and Database Unaware (without UID change detection). UID handling is specific to a player, and different players on the same TG device may behave in different ways. Support for UID change detection is indicated in the media player feature bitmask (see Table 6.46). Database aware players shall maintain a UID counter that is incremented whenever the database changes."

The UID shall be unique within a scope with the exception of the Virtual Media Player Filesystem on database unaware media players as described in Section 6.10.3.1. Scope is defined in Section 6.10.1.2.\n\nWithin the Virtual Media Player Filesystem, a UID uniquely identifies a Media Element Item. If the same Media Element Item is present at more than one location in the Virtual Media Player Filesystem, then it may have the same UID in each location. Within the Now Playing list, a UID uniquely identifies a Media Element Item. If the same Media Element Item is present in more than one location in the Now Playing list, each instance shall have a different UID.\n\nThe value of UID=0x0 is a special value used only to request the metadata for the currently playing media using the GetElementAttributes command and shall not be used for any item in a folder.\n\nThe UID shall be used whenever a media element is required to be identified. For example, it may be used in conjunction with the GettleAttributes command to obtain metadata information about a specific media element, or in combination with ChangePath to change to a specific folder.\n\nThe UID scope is limited to one player, even if that player may have unique UIDs across its virtual filesystem. For example, a media element with the UID 1 in the folder hierarchy for player 1 may be a different media element to that with the UID 1 in the folder hierarchy for player 2.\n\nThere are two different ways a Media Player on a target may handle the UID, depending on the nature of the Media Player: Database Aware (with UID change detection) and Database Unaware (without UID change detection). UID handling is specific to a player, and different players on the same TG device may behave in different ways. Support for UID change detection is indicated in the media player feature bitmask (see Table 6.46). Database aware players shall maintain a UID counter that is incremented whenever the database changes."

The CT may specify a range of entries to be returned. This means that a CT which can only display a limited number of items can obtain a listing one part at a time as the user scrolls the display. If possible, the returned list should resemble the order used on the local display on the TG, but should list all folder items before media element items to facilitate browsing on the CT.\n\nTo allow the CT to request specific Metadata Attributes be returned along with each media element in the folder listing, the command shall include a filter specifying which metadata attributes are requested to be returned by the TG. The TG should provide the available attribute values in the response. The TG is not required to provide a value for all requested attributes.\n\nThe CT should not issue a GetFolderItems command to an empty folder. If the TG receives a GetFolderItems command for an empty folder, then the TG shall return the error (= Range Out of Bounds) in the status field of the GetFolderItems response.\n\nIn some situations the CT may issue a command where the response with full data would exceed the maximum size of AVRCP PDU, which the CT can handle. In this case the TG should prefer to return complete items. So if four items were requested with three attributes each, then the TG should return as many items as can be returned with full attribute data. If the response containing only one item still exceeds the size which can be handled by the CT, then the TG should return less attributes than are requested."

The CT may specify a range of entries to be returned. This means that a CT which can only display a limited number of items can obtain a listing one part at a time as the user scrolls the display. If possible, the returned list should resemble the order used on the local display on the TG, but should list all folder items before media element items to facilitate browsing on the CT.\n\nTo allow the CT to request specific Metadata Attributes be returned along with each media element in the folder listing, the command shall include a filter specifying which metadata attributes are requested to be returned by the TG. The TG should provide the available attribute values in the response. The TG is not required to provide a value for all requested attributes.\n\nThe CT should not issue a GetFolderItems command to an empty folder. If the TG receives a GetFolderItems command for an empty folder, then the TG shall return the error (= Range Out of Bounds) in the status field of the GetFolderItems response.\n\nIn some situations the CT may issue a command where the response with full data would exceed the maximum size of AVRCP PDU, which the CT can handle. In this case the TG should prefer to return complete items. So if four items were requested with three attributes each, then the TG should return as many items as can be returned with full attribute data. If the response containing only one item still exceeds the size which can be handled by the CT, then the TG should return less attributes than are requested."

The CT may specify a range of entries to be returned. This means that a CT which can only display a limited number of items can obtain a listing one part at a time as the user scrolls the display. If possible, the returned list should resemble the order used on the local display on the TG, but should list all folder items before media element items to facilitate browsing on the CT.\n\nTo allow the CT to request specific Metadata Attributes be returned along with each media element in the folder listing, the command shall include a filter specifying which metadata attributes are requested to be returned by the TG. The TG should provide the available attribute values in the response. The TG is not required to provide a value for all requested attributes.\n\nThe CT should not issue a GetFolderItems command to an empty folder. If the TG receives a GetFolderItems command for an empty folder, then the TG shall return the error (= Range Out of Bounds) in the status field of the GetFolderItems response.\n\nIn some situations the CT may issue a command where the response with full data would exceed the maximum size of AVRCP PDU, which the CT can handle. In this case the TG should prefer to return complete items. So if four items were requested with three attributes each, then the TG should return as many items as can be returned with full attribute data. If the response containing only one item still exceeds the size which can be handled by the CT, then the TG should return less attributes than are requested."

The CT may specify a range of entries to be returned. This means that a CT which can only display a limited number of items can obtain a listing one part at a time as the user scrolls the display. If possible, the returned list should resemble the order used on the local display on the TG, but should list all folder items before media element items to facilitate browsing on the CT.\n\nTo allow the CT to request specific Metadata Attributes be returned along with each media element in the folder listing, the command shall include a filter specifying which metadata attributes are requested to be returned by the TG. The TG should provide the available attribute values in the response. The TG is not required to provide a value for all requested attributes.\n\nThe CT should not issue a GetFolderItems command to an empty folder. If the TG receives a GetFolderItems command for an empty folder, then the TG shall return the error (= Range Out of Bounds) in the status field of the GetFolderItems response.\n\nIn some situations the CT may issue a command where the response with full data would exceed the maximum size of AVRCP PDU, which the CT can handle. In this case the TG should prefer to return complete items. So if four items were requested with three attributes each, then the TG should return as many items as can be returned with full attribute data. If the response containing only one item still exceeds the size which can be handled by the CT, then the TG should return less attributes than are requested."

The CT may specify a range of entries to be returned. This means that a CT which can only display a limited number of items can obtain a listing one part at a time as the user scrolls the display. If possible, the returned list should resemble the order used on the local display on the TG, but should list all folder items before media element items to facilitate browsing on the CT.\n\nTo allow the CT to request specific Metadata Attributes be returned along with each media element in the folder listing, the command shall include a filter specifying which metadata attributes are requested to be returned by the TG. The TG should provide the available attribute values in the response. The TG is not required to provide a value for all requested attributes.\n\nThe CT should not issue a GetFolderItems command to an empty folder. If the TG receives a GetFolderItems command for an empty folder, then the TG shall return the error (= Range Out of Bounds) in the status field of the GetFolderItems response.\n\nIn some situations the CT may issue a command where the response with full data would exceed the maximum size of AVRCP PDU, which the CT can handle. In this case the TG should prefer to return complete items. So if four items were requested with three attributes each, then the TG should return as many items as can be returned with full attribute data. If the response containing only one item still exceeds the size which can be handled by the CT, then the TG should return less attributes than are requested."

This may occur if the application on the TG changes, or the application changes mode, for instance, different functionality may be available when the TG is playing locally stored audio tracks to when it is acting as a radio. How this is handled by the CT is implementation dependent. If the TG application changes to support less functionality, the CT may receive error responses indicating that the function requested is not implemented. The CT may then decide to reissue the GetCapabilities to get the most current capabilities. If the TG application changes to support more features, the CT may be happy to continue using the original set of features supported. If not, it may choose to occasionally poll the TG with a GetCapabilities to determine when further capabilities are available."
