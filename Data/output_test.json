For more information of the AV/C unit/subunit model and AV/C command operation, refer to\nAV/C General Specification [1] and AV/C Panel Subunit Specification [2]. Version 4.1 in [1] is backwards\ncompatible with version 4.0 in [1], so either version can be used.\n\n\nThe AV/C General Specification covers the AV/C general command and response model, unit/subunit\nmodel, and standard unit and subunit commands. An AV/C subunit is an instantiation of a logical entity\nthat is identified within an AV/C unit. An AV/C subunit has a set of coherent functions that the electronic\ndevice provides. Functions are defined for each category of devices in its subunit specification (Monitor,\nAudio, Tape recorder/player, Disc, Tuner, etc.).\n\n\nThe AV/C command set consists of the AV/C General Specification and each subunit command. In the\nAV/C General Specification, the UNIT INFO command and SUBUNIT INFO command are both\nmandatory. For subunit commands, the mandatory commands are defined in each subunit specification,\nand it depends on the device implementation which subunit to support.\n\n\nThe UNIT INFO command is used to obtain information that pertains to the AV/C unit as a whole. The\nresponse frame includes information of the vendor ID of the TG and subunit type that best describes the\nunit. The information of vendor ID may be used to investigate the vendor of TG before using VENDOR\nDEPENDENT command. For example of subunit type, a VCR device may return the _unit_type_ of the tape\nrecorder/player, even though the VCR has a tuner. In this profile, the panel subunit is the main function. It\nis also possible that other subunits may be returned if other profiles co-exist in the device.\n\n\nThe SUBUNIT INFO command is used to obtain information about the subunit(s) of an AV/C unit. A\ndevice with this profile may support other subunits than the panel subunit if other profiles co-exist in the\ndevice, which can be found with the SUBUNIT INFO command. With this command, a typical AV/C\ncontroller manipulates AV/C function discovery.\n\n\nThe VENDOR DEPENDENT command permits module vendors to specify their own set of commands\nand responses for AV/C units or subunits determined by the AV/C address that is contained in the AV/C\nframe. The vendor dependent commands are used by this specification. Please refer to Section 4.1.5.\n\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **29 of 170**\n\n\n**Audio/Video Remote Control Profile /** Profile Specification\n\n\nOne feature of this profile is the remote control performed by the PASS THROUGH command of the\nPanel subunit. The Panel subunit provides a user-centric model for actuating the controls on a device.\nThe CT controls the Panel subunit according to the user operation using certain CT-dependent manners.\nThe user manipulates the user interface on the display or operates a button, and then the CT sends\ncommands to the panel subunit. In response to these commands, the Panel subunit performs some\naction(s). Even though there may be several subunits in a TG, the TG shall have only one panel subunit.\nUnlike many other AV/C subunits, the panel subunit does not directly deal with media streams itself. The\nmain purpose for using a panel subunit is to allow it to translate the incoming user action commands into\ninternal actions, which affect other subunits and/or the unit, and dispatch them to an appropriate subunit\nor unit inside the TG using the TG-dependent manner. The result of these actions may have an effect on\nmedia streams. This profile uses the PASS THROUGH command, which is one of the subunit commands\ndefined in the Panel Subunit Specification. A CT conveys a user operation to a TG by the PASS\nTHROUGH command."

The BIP Generic\nImaging Image Pull feature is used to provide functionality to allow the CT (acting as the Imaging Initiator)\nto retrieve images associated with the media on the TG (acting as the Imaging Responder). These\ncommands are used over an OBEX connection.\n\n###### **Capabilities**\n\n\nCT shall have the ability to query the capabilities of TG. The following capabilities can be queried:\n\n\n1. List of Company IDs supported by TG. For details refer to Section 6.4.\n\n\n2. List of Event IDs supported by TG. For details refer to Section 6.4 and Section 27.\n\n\n3. Player Application specific feature bitmask. This is part of the Media Player Item which can be\n\nretrieved by browsing the available media players with the GetFolderItems command in the scope of\nthe Media Player List. For details also refer to Section 6.10.2.1 and Section 24.19.\n\n###### **Target player application settings**\n\n\nPlayer application settings commands provide a mechanism for CT devices to query player application\nsetting attributes on the TG and to get and set specific setting values for these attributes.\n\n\nAll player application settings are available on the target as an <attribute, value> pair. For each player\napplication attribute there shall be multiple possible values, with one of them being the current set value.\n\n\nThe specification defines pre-defined attributes and values for some of the commonly used player\napplication settings, defined in Appendix F: list of defined player application settings and values of this\nspecification.\n\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **41 of 170**\n\n\n**Audio/Video Remote Control Profile /** Profile Specification\n\n\nThe PDUs allow for extensions to the pre-defined attributes and values defined in the target and are\naccessible to the controller, along with displayable text. This will allow controllers without the semantic\nunderstanding of the target’s player application setting to be able to extend their menu by displaying\nsetting related text and provide users with a mechanism to operate on the player application settings.\n\n\nEach player application setting has a unique AttributeID and the attributes have values that have a\nValueID. Target-defined attributes and values have displayable text associated with them for allowing the\nCT to be able to provide menu extensions to existing media players.\n\n\nRefer to Section 6.5 for the list of PDUs.\n\n###### **Metadata attributes for current media item**\n\n\nMetadata attributes for the currently playing media element may be retrieved by the CT using the\nGetElementAttributes command. This allows the CT to request a specific set, or all attributes from the TG.\nThese attributes include such things as title and artist.\n\n###### **Event notifications from target device**\n\n\nThe following capabilities are provided as part of event notifications from the target device:\n\n\n1. CT has the capability to access current play status in addition to media track duration and current\n\nposition of the track.\n\n\n2. Events that can be monitored on the target are:\n\n\na. Play status events of the current media track\n\n\n    - Playing\n\n    - Paused\n\n    - Stopped\n\n    - Seek Forward\n\n    - Seek Rewind\n\n    - Playback position change\n\n\nb. Track change events\n\n\n    - Change of track\n\n    - Start of track\n\n    - End of track\n\n\nc. Device unplugged event, to support target-end external adapters to media devices.\nd. All player application attributes can be registered as events by the CT. The TG shall notify the CT\n\non change in value of the corresponding device setting by the local TG device.\ne. Volume change on the TG device\nf. Available players changed\ng. Addressed player changed\nh. UIDs changed\ni. Content of Now Playing folder changed\n\n\n3. CT devices have the capability to provide a NOTIFY AV/C command to the TG, to register for specific\n\nevents on the TG.\n\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **42 of 170**\n\n\n**Audio/Video Remote Control Profile /** Profile Specification\n\n\n4. The TG shall for every supported NOTIFY AV/C command send an INTERIM response to the CT with\n\nthe current status of the registered event within TMTP from the time of registration.\n\n\n5. On the occurrence of a registered event, TG device shall send a CHANGED response to the CT with\n\nthe current status\n\n\n6. As per AV/C protocol a NOTIFY command terminates after providing a corresponding CHANGED. It\n\nis recommended that CT devices that need periodic updates on selected events re-register for those\nevents after the receipt of the corresponding CHANGED as they will only receive an update when\nthere is an outstanding NOTIFY to complete.\n\n\n7. As per AVCTP, there shall be only 16 outstanding transaction labels at any instant of time on each\n\nAVCTP channel. This shall limit the number of events that can be simultaneously registered or\npending response to 15.\n\n###### **Continuation**\n\n\nContinuation enables the TG to create responses larger than the maximum AV/C frame size of 512 octets\nby providing commands to handle a fragmented AVRCP specific AV/C command. The commands\ninclude:\n\n\n- Request for continuation packets\n\n\n- Abort continuation of current message\n\n\nThe packet type on the PDU response from TG shall indicate whether the PDU is a start packet with\nadditional packets available for CT. The CT can then request for continuation packets using the\nRequestContinuingResponse command till end of packet is signaled on the PDU packet type.\n\n\nThe CT has the option to abort the current PDU continuation by sending AbortContinuingResponse\ncommand at any time after the reception of the first PDU response for the corresponding PDU command.\n\n[/E3155]\n\n\nNote that Continuation is required due to the limit of 512 octets per AV/C frame. Continuation is therefore\nonly necessary for AV/C commands.\n\n###### **Group navigation**\n\n\nGroup navigation provides the ability for CT to logically view TG media storage as a flat structure. Groups\nare logical blocks of media tracks defined by TG. This could be play lists, folders or any other logical\nstructure as deemed fit by TG. By doing this CT shall be able to move to next and previous groups on TG\nwithout any knowledge on the media storage mechanism of TG.\n\n###### **Absolute volume**\n\n\nThis feature provides volume handling functionality to allow the CT to show a volume level slider or\nequivalent.\n\n\nTwo commands are provided to allow an absolute volume to be set, and for volume changes to be\nobserved.\n\n\nThe SetAbsoluteVolume command is used to set an absolute volume to be used by the rendering device.\nThis is in addition to the relative volume PASS THROUGH commands. It is expected that the audio sink\nwill perform as the TG for this command.\n\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **43 of 170**\n\n\n**Audio/Video Remote Control Profile /** Profile Specification\n\n\nThe RegisterNotification command for the Volume Changed Event is used by the CT to detect when the\nvolume has been changed locally on the TG, or what the actual volume level is following use of relative\nvolume commands.\n\n###### **Media player selection**\n\n\nA device that supports the media source role may contain zero or more media players. For the purposes\nof this document, a media player is defined as an entity which can fulfill the requirements of this\nspecification. Whether there is a one to one mapping between media player entities as presented over\nAVRCP and applications on the device is implementation dependent.\n\n\nThere may be a variety of media players, including music players, video players, streaming players, FM\nradios, mobile TV tuners, etc. To allow media playing to be controlled from a remote device it is possible\nfor that device to select which media player it wants to control the play status for and which player it\nwishes to navigate the media content of.\n\n\nThe media content available to be played is dependent on what media player is currently selected, for\nexample a radio application may offer a variety of radio stations, whereas an audio media player may\noffer audio tracks present on local storage.\n\n\nFunctionality is available to allow a CT to view available media players on the TG, select a media player\nto control and a media player to browse the media content of, and to be notified of changes to the\navailable media players.\n\n\nThe media player selection functionality allows a TG device to support a range of media players with\nvarying functionality. All media player applications on an AVRCP 1.4 TG device may not support the full\nrange of AVRCP 1.4 features even though the Bluetooth AVRCP 1.4 profile implementation is capable of\nsupporting these. For example, a device may have two media player applications, one fully featured\napplication supporting browsing functionality and one which was written to support AVRCP 1.3 which only\nprovides basic control and Metadata access. To allow the CT to make a decision about which player to\nselect the capabilities of each player are published in a Player Feature Bitmask. This is part of the Media\nPlayer Item which can be retrieved by browsing the available media players."

Refer to Section 6.10.1 for more information on scope. The\nbrowsed player is an AVRCP concept and is independent of any media browsing which occurs locally on\nthe TG device.\n\n###### **Now Playing**\n\n\nMany media players support the concept of a Now Playing list or Queue. This is effectively a dynamic\nplaylist containing the media items currently scheduled to be played. The order of items in the Now\nPlaying list supplied to the CT should reflect the order they appear on the media player application on the\nTG.\n\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **44 of 170**\n\n\n**Audio/Video Remote Control Profile /** Profile Specification\n\n\nAlthough a media player application may not support the concept of a Now Playing list natively, there are\na variety of ways in which it could choose to populate the Now Playing list. For example, it could just\nplace the currently playing media item in the Now Playing list, or it could place the contents of the\ncurrently playing folder in the Now Playing list.\n\n\nThe Now Playing list may be examined using AVRCP browsing functionality. Items on the Now Playing\nlist may be acted upon similarly to other media items in the virtual media filesystem. In addition,\nfunctionality is available to allow items to be added to the Now Playing list.\n\n###### **UID**\n\n\nMedia elements are identified within the virtual filesystem by an 8 octet identifier, the UID. This allows\nindividual items to be specified as the target of an operation, for example the PlayItem command takes a\nUID as a parameter to specify which media element should be played."

A TG device that supports the\nUID Counter shall update the value of the counter on each change to the media database.\n\n###### **Search**\n\n\nThe search functionality allows the CT to locate specific media elements on the TG. On the typical target\ndevices it is unlikely that full metadata will be available for all content, either because it is not present as\npart of the available media data, or because the interface between the Bluetooth stack and the media\nplayer does not allow this to be accessed. For this reason, a fully featured search facility offering, for\ninstance, functions such as search within genre or artist, is not available. Instead, only basic search\nfunctionality is provided with basic string search.\n\n\nAdvanced search facilities, such as search on artist are not supported. However, equivalent filtering may\nbe possible using search within folder on folders which contain specific types of content, as folders have\nproperties which include the type of content they hold (see Section 6.10.2.2). For example, if the CT\nnavigates to the /Artists/ArtistA folder and searches on string “Track” it should be equivalent to searching\nfor the string “Track” in media element items where the artist is ArtistA, dependent on media player\nbehavior.\n\n###### **Browsing**\n\n\nBrowsing functionality allows a CT device to navigate and view media content on the TG.

In the case of a non-fragmented message, this field\n(Packet Type=00) simply indicates that the message is sent in a single AV/C frame.\n\n\nThe packets are fragmented by the TG so as to be able to accommodate into the 512 octet AV/C packet\nsize restriction. CTs have the flexibility to request continuation packets at their convenience from the TG\nor abort the continuation request. Note: if the L2CAP MTU is less than 512 octets, AVCTP shall also\napply fragmentation to each of the AV/C packets. All response fragments shall have the same PDU ID as\nthe original request.\n\n\nA TG shall not interleave fragmented PDUs.

Therefore, a TG can return a volume level that is different from the level\nrequested in the command parameters. For example, the TG might have a coarse granularity of volume\ncontrol and engage a level near the requested level, or the TG might enforce a maximum volume limit\nbased on a device policy, or the TG might be handling a concurrent and conflicting volume change\noriginating from its own device user interface or another CT.\n\n\nWhen the volume is changed on the TG by this command, the Volume Change notification shall not be\ncompleted.\n\n\nThe Set Absolute Volume command is transported as an AV/C Control command.

Unless otherwise stated in the following\nsections, L2CAP requirements are as specified in the Core Specification and the Enhanced L2CAP\nAddendum [14].\n\n\nThe Bluetooth Core Specification and the Enhanced L2CAP Addendum [14] include useful capabilities in\nthe L2CAP Resource Manager which are specified as optional in version 2.1 and earlier. AVRCP\nhowever, requires and benefits from some of these features, including: Protocol/channel multiplexing,\nSegmentation and Reassembly, per-L2CAP-channel flow control, and per-L2CAP channel error control\nretransmissions. The requirements and implementation details of these beneficial features are discussed\nthroughout this section.\n\n\nThe likely presence of an active Streaming Data Channel for media streaming while AVRCP is in use\nimplies that Browse Channel packets may need to be flushed at the ACL link. When Streaming and\nBrowsing Channels share the same ACL link, flushing can result in temporary loss of a few reliable\nchannel packets, however, Enhanced Retransmission Mode in the Browsing Channel will eventually retransmit the flushed packets and the Browsing Channel will still maintain reliability.\n\n\nOn the Browsing Channel, marking packets as non-flushable can ensure efficient use of the L2CAP\nEnhanced Retransmission Mode by preventing unnecessary retransmission overhead. The 2.1 + EDR\ncore specification added a feature called Non-Flushable Packet Boundary Flag for this purpose.\n\n###### **Channel types**\n\n\nIn this profile, only connection-oriented channels shall be used. This implies that broadcasts shall not be\nused in this profile.\n\n\nIn the PSM field of the Connection Request packet, the value for AVCTP defined in the Bluetooth\nAssigned Numbers document [6] shall be used.\n\n###### **Signaling**\n\n\nAVRCP does not impose any restrictions or requirements on L2CAP signaling.\n\n###### **Configuration options**\n\n\nThis section describes the usage of configuration options in AVRCP."

If the TG receives a\nGetFolderItems command for an empty folder, then the TG shall return the error (= Range Out of Bounds)\nin the status field of the GetFolderItems response.\n\n\nIn some situations the CT may issue a command where the response with full data would exceed the\nmaximum size of AVRCP PDU, which the CT can handle. In this case the TG should prefer to return\ncomplete items. So if four items were requested with three attributes each, then the TG should return as\nmany items as can be returned with full attribute data. If the response containing only one item still\nexceeds the size which can be handled by the CT, then the TG should return less attributes than are\nrequested."

When there are two devices, one simply works as the CT and another simply as the TG; the\nconnection on an L2CAP channel between them can be established or released by an application as the\nneed arises. However, when one of the devices supports several profiles or two roles, the CT and the TG,\nthe operation to release a connection should be manipulated carefully.\n\n\nFor example, even if application ‘A’ wants to discard a connection for control, another application ‘B’ may\nneed the connection kept established. If application ‘A’ releases the connection on its own judgment, and\nthen if application ‘B’ needs to send a command, application ‘B’ shall re-establish another connection for\ncontrol to send a command, which causes a delay.\n\n\nA necessary connection to be released by another application can be avoided by implementation. That is,\nbefore releasing the connection for control, an application should try to investigate whether other profiles\nor other role of the same profile in the device uses AVCTP. It is recommended to apply above\nimplementation solution when developing a device that supports both CT and TG, or supports another\ncontrol profile in addition to AVRCP.\n\n\nBluetooth SIG Proprietary Page **120 of 170**\n\n\n**Audio/Video Remote Control Profile /** Profile Specification\n\n### **24 Appendix D: example of commands and responses**\n\n\nThis chapter shows several examples of commands from a CT and responses from a TG exchanged in\ncase a TG supports only AVRCP as its AV control profile. Note that the structures of commands and\nresponses mentioned in this chapter are merely examples, and fields may have different structures or\nvalues according to the situations.
