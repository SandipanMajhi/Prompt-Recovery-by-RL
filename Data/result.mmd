Changed Notification, the CT should not send any player specific command to the TG. In case the TG receives any player specific command for a player not yet successfully opened, it should reply with Error Code 0x13 (Player Not Addressed).

The parameters for the Set Addressed Player command and response are given in Section 6.9.1.1 and Section 6.9.1.2. An example of a SetAddressedPlayer command is given in Section 24.11.

### 6.9.2 Addressed Player Changed notification

The Addressed Player Changed notification allows the CT to be informed if the addressed player on the TG is changed.

This is an event which may be used for the Register Notification command described in Section 6.7.2, which is a vendor dependent AV/C Notify. The response format for this event is the Player Id of the addressed player.

The interim response to the Notify shall contain the Player Id of the current addressed player. If the CT registers this Notify before sending a SetAddressedPlayer command the interim response contains the Player Id of the default player on the TG.

The response parameters are given in Section 6.9.2.1. The command parameters are described in Section 6.7.2. It should be noted that the 4 octet playback interval field is present in the command parameters due to the definition of the Register Notification command but is ignored for this event.

An example PDU for this command is given in Section 24.12.

### 6.9.2.1 Response parameters

**Player Id – 2 Octets**

| Value | Parameter Description |
|-------|
| 0xXXXX| Unique Media Player Id as defined in Section 6.10
