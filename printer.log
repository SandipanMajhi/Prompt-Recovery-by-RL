I really like Firefox but I find that it is missing one key feature for me to transition from Mozilla 1.7.12 to Firefox 1.5.0.4, that is the lack of the same Mozilla "Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs" feature in Firefox. Now I know that Firefox has a "Bookmark All Tabs..." option but unlike Mozilla it creates a folder just like any other and has an option to "open in tabs" at the bottom of the folder. I can see why they did this and it would be nice to be able to enter a bookmark group to access only one tab... Yet it is something that is really rarely needed and could be done by hovering over the tab group for a short while. Now this might seam like a minor gripe considering all the other positives Firefox has over Mozilla, Yet I am truly addicted to the bookmark group in Mozilla and there are a few main reasons behind this: \n     * it looks different than the other folders and is easy to distinguish\n     * one simple click on the bookmark group to open it\n     * The "Bookmark This _G_ roup of Tabs" defaults to show you the file tree (for lack of a better term) giving you a quicker way to save the bookmark group.\nNow I have been unable to find any extention that would allow me to use the\nsame Mozilla bookmark group functions inside of Firefox.

It is possible to share that file with others (by doing\nthings that Firefox remains blissfully unaware of, such as using symlinks or\nsynching the file), but that only works for sharing the _entire_ bookmarks;\nI've encountered several situations where I wish to share just some of my\nbookmarks, a subtree of them say:\n\n  * I use Firefox at both home and work. Generally, I do different things in each place, so they have different bookmarks: at work, I have lots of prominent links to internal systems, which I hardly ever need to access from home. However, there are some bookmark folders I'd like to have in both places, such as those with links to technical reference material like the W3C specs.\n\n  * Everybody in the team at work needs bookmarks (with keywords for URL searches) to the same internal systems. We've all had to accumulate these individually. It would be nice just to have them in one place, so we know they are all exactly the same (and new people can easily be given them, too).\n\n  * Sometimes, I give presentations using Firefox for rendering HTML slides. I have a separate profile for that, with settings more appropriate for use in front of an audience on a big screen, but it'd be nice to have a subset of my normal bookmarks available.\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be trivial to do, and is very hard to do well. At the\nmoment, I don't think it's possible at all. The bare minimum support that I\nthink is needed from Firefox is the ability to combine bookmark subtrees from\ndifferent sources. That is, that at some point in _bookmarks.html_ there can\nbe a 'linked folder' which renders just like an ordinary folder but whose\ncontent is stored in a separate file; _bookmarks.html_ just contains the\nfolder's label and the path to that file.\n\nThen all the synching can be managed outside Firefox (or with extensions or\nwhatever) —�so long as the basic 'subtree combining' feature is there (even if\nit requires manually setting up) other things can be added on top of it.\n\nThis could be done in conjuntion with tagging.

Adding and deleting bookmarks should work as usual, but\nwith the results being stored remotely, on a server (such as\n<http://del.icio.us>).\n\nI agree! I use different computers at home, work, and school, and love having\naccess to one respository of "bookmarks," stored online. Having a slick\ninterface to such a repository would be an excellent, often-used feature.\n\nThis is the one reason that I have abandoned traditional bookmarks in favor of\na web-based solution, [myhq.com](http://www.myhq.com). Another option is to\nuse a third-party toolbar such as <http://toolbar.a9.com/>\n\nBuilding on this idea further: There are some bookmarks that I would want to\nshare with others. It would be nice to syndicate them with RSS and display\nthem on a website as a feed or formatted with CSS. This could be through a\nservice or via a plugin for blogging software.\n\nThe other point here is that there are cases where I don\'t want to share my\nbookmarks. E.g. links to financial information, services like my web host and\nmy flickr login. I keep these in a separate folder so I would only need to\nexclude that folder from export.\n\nOn the synchronization of bookmarks, you might want to check out how that is\nhandled in [Open-Xchange.](http://mirror.open-xchange.org/ox/EN/community/)\n\nI would love to be able to get rid of bookmarks folders altogether with\ntagging. As such I wouldn\'t want to have to keep private bookmarks in a\ndifferent folder than public/shared bookmarks\n\nI, too agree with this. Have a simple xml file (hopefully hosted by mozilla,\nbut of course with its limits... maybe google could help out ;) ). When you\nload firefox, firefox would check for any changes to the file on the server.\nIf none are found, it stops. If changes are found, it downloads them.\n\nSaving bookmarks could either be instantly (this may cause a small wait period\nfor slower users), when the bookmark list is not being used, or \'onClose\' if\nthat even exists.\n\nUsing [OPML](http://www.opml.org/) might be a win for this over RSS. OPML\nallows for hierarchical data like bookmark folders. Also bookmarks are more of\na list type thing than a feed type thing. Of course you could have both.\n\nIncluding features found in:\n[bookmarksync](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bookmarksync) would be great.\nThis is a big issue for me, too. - and being able to edit and change the\nhosting server as a preference would be great. thx.

The code would seem to be around as\npart of the Sunbird project where it is used to sync up local and remote ical\nfiles. That would make it easy to share a sub-tree of your bookmarks between\nlocations/computers/people and give some control over who gets to add/change\nand who gets to read only.\n\nThe first post pretty much had it!

That\'s pretty handy.\n    [Mikelward](/User:Mikelward "User:Mikelward") 03:14, 7 June 2007 (PDT)\n\nEventually it becomes easier to Google for the links anew rather than hunt\nthrough the unweildy bookmark list. Faciliating management of these issues\nwould be very helpful for maintaining a streamlined, functional list. Some\npossibilities:\n\n### Live Collections Using Advanced Metadata\n\nSimilar to the Live Folders concept mentioned above, but allow bookmarks to be\nautomatically collected based on metadata _other than_ just tags (such as\nserver-provided data).\n\nFor instance, periodically do HTTP HEAD requests to bookmarked addresses, and\nflag those that return statuses other than 200 OK. Collected into live folders\nbased on their status codes, the user would be able to easily cull dead links\nand decide whether to update the moved ones.\n\nLikewise, allow bookmarks to be grouped based on criteria such as last access\ndate (to cull, or rediscover, links you never use anymore), the page\'s Last-\nModified date (to identify resources that have grown irrelevant), and\nduplicate/similar addresses (including those that have obviously different\nURLs but would become redundant based on a 301/302 status update).\n\nIf the client-side metadata (such as last access) could be shared across\nworkstations (i.e. between work and home computers), that would also be cool.\n\n### Visual Cues in Bookmarks Menu\n\nFavicons and screenshot previews are helpful visual cues about a bookmark.\nExtend this concept to other metadata. For instance, maybe the user would want\n404s to be grayed out, and recently-visited links to be bolded. Or certain\ntags might be asssociated with small graphics similar to favicons, so the user\ncan quickly skim down a long list, identify the few bookmarks that meet\nhis/her criteria (ex. "IE + hacks + 4stars")--even through he doesn\'t recall\ntheir titles.\n\nThis could also be done through the use of super-imposed mini-icons over the\nfavicon. It would be similar to the shortcut arrow that windows and mac users\nare familiar with. Perhaps a tiny **(X)** in the bottom right side of the\nfavicon for a bookmark that was a 404, or a colored star system for the\nrating, etc.\n\n### Bookmarks Menu Sorting\n\nAllow user-defined sorting of the Bookmarks menu. Chronological order quickly\nbecomes non-meaningful in a long list. Allow sorting by title, domain, or\ndate, etc.\n\nA pair of persistent no-sort options too, please, on a folder by folder basis.\nNo sort folder contents only, no sort entire folder substructure. I often do\nnot want particular folders sorted, particularly when exporting bookmarks to\nedit them into a web page. If you also increased the size of the manager\'s\ndescription form, I could go back to using the bookmarks tools as a handy\noutliner like I did in Mozilla. A related enhancement: enable separate\nexporting of bookmarks folder substructures with a templating capability so\nusers and developers can more easily define export formats, and add export to\nclipboard (rather than a file) as an option. Fore some ideas on\nimplementation, see the CopyURL-Plus extension, the handiest browser extension\non my desktop.--Marbux\n\nIt would also be useful to be able to sort the folders/subfolders separately\nfrom the individual pages.
